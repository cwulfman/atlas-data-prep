documentation and scripts for preparing data for ATLAS


I have also placed the non-Capitains data currently being ingested into ATLAS v2 (new-atlas) in the `test-data` directory but this is being refactored and documented. The data itself will likely be moved elsewhere other than some examples and test cases to be left here.


## Overview

Currently being ingested into ATLAS v2 (although still subject to modification):

* texts
* dictionaries
* alignments
* morphology
* text annotations
* attributions
* named entities
* metrical annotations
* audio annotations
* image annotations

Others coming soon:

* commentaries
* grammatical entries
* syntax trees
* token annotations
