5.1 Dawn, out of her bed from beside noble Tithonus, 
5.2 began to rouse herself, so that she might carry in light to the undying gods and to the mortal men. 
5.3 The gods started to take their seats in their places, and among them then was 
5.4 Zeus, who thunders on high, and whose power is the greatest. 
5.5 To them Athena began narrating the many troubles of Odysseus, 
5.6 bringing these things to mind- for he was a concern to her, because he was in the house of the woman: 
5.7 “Father Zeus and the other blessed gods, who exist forever, 
5.8 may not anyone be eagerly mild and kind, 
5.9 the staff-holding king, nor may he know righteous things in his heart, 
5.10 but may he always be harsh, and let him do evil things- 
5.11 because not one has until now brought to mind god-like Odysseus 
5.12 of the people for whom he was lord; he was kind like a father. 
5.13 But yet he lies on the island, suffering powerful sorrows 
5.14 in the great rooms of the nymph Calypso, she who by force 
5.15 holds him back: and still he is not able to return to his own fatherland, 
5.16 for there are no ships equipped with oars nor comrades with him 
5.17 who might escort him home over the wide surface of the sea. 
5.18 Again now they have done everything in their power to kill his beloved child, 
5.19 as he returns home: for he went after what people had heard about his father, 
5.20 to most holy Pylos and to heavenly Lacedaemon. 
5.21 And answering her, Zeus the cloud-summoner spoke: 
5.22 “My child, what a speech of yours escaped from the fence of your teeth- 
5.23 for did you not in truth plan this scheme yourself, 
5.24 that surely Odysseus himself will exact vengeance on those people after his arrival? 
5.25 But you, get Telemachus home in your clever way, for you are able, 
5.26 so that he, quite unhurt, may reach his own fatherland, 
5.27 and the suitors may depart back again in their ship. 
5.28 And then, facing Hermes, his beloved son, he began speaking: 
5.29 “Hermes, of course since you are a messenger in other things, 
5.30 say to the beautiful-haired nymph this authoritative decision: 
5.31 the return of Odysseus, he whose heart has endured much, so that he may return home 
5.32 through the guidance neither of the gods nor of mortal humans; 
5.33 instead may that man, suffering hardships, on a boat with many fastenings 
5.34 reach fertile Scheria on the twentieth day, 
5.35 to the land of the Phaeacians, who were born closely-connected to the gods, 
5.36 and who will show him respect to the highest degree in their heart, as they would a god, 
5.37 and they will send him in a ship to the beloved land belonging to my fathers 
5.38 having given him bronze and gold and clothing in heaps, 
5.39 many things- as many as Odysseus never would have carried out for himself from Troy ever, 
5.40 even if he had come without suffering, having collected his share out of the war-spoils. 
5.41 For this is his fate, both to see those who are dear to him and to return 
5.42 to his high-ceilinged home, and into his own fatherland. 
5.43 So he spoke, and the messenger, the slayer of Argus, did not disobey. 
5.44 At once he bound under his feet his beautiful sandals, 
5.45 the kind that are suited to a god, gold, those which would bear him over both the water 
5.46 and over the boundless land alongside the blasts of wind. 
5.47 He took hold of his wand, with which he enchants the eyes of men, 
5.48 of whomever he chooses, and also wakes again those who are sleeping. 
5.49 Holding this between his hands, the powerful slayer of Argus began to fly, 
5.50 and, having mounted Pieria from the sky, he plunged towards the sea. 
5.51 Then he swept over a wave like a skimmer-bird, 
5.52 which, while down along the terrible swells of the barren sea, 
5.53 hunting fish, wets its dense wings in the salt-sea; 
5.54 like this Hermes rode upon the many waves. 
5.55 But when he arrived at the island that was far away, 
5.56 there, after stepping out of the deep-blue sea, towards the mainland 
5.57 he made his way until he came upon the great cave, in which the beautiful-haired nymph 
5.58 was living: and he found her being within. 
5.59 On one side a great fire was burning in the hearth, while in the distance the smell 
5.60 of both split cedar and juniper spread its fragrance up through the island 
5.61 as they blazed. And she, singing with a beautiful voice inside, 
5.62 walking back and forth before the loom, was weaving with a golden pin-beater. 
5.63 A forest had grown up all around the cave, flourishing: 
5.64 alder and poplar and sweet-smelling cypress. 
5.65 There long-winged birds would nest: 
5.66 owls and falcons and sharp-tongued crows 
5.67 of the sea; to them, the affairs of the sea are their business. 
5.68 And this had stretched itself right there, all around the hollow cave, 
5.69 the youthful garden-vine, and it had already bloomed with grape-bunches. 
5.70 Springs, four in a row, continuously bubbled with white water 
5.71 next to one another, having turned themselves in one way, then another. 
5.72 All around soft meadows of violets and parsley 
5.73 were blooming; and there and then even an immortal, having approached, 
5.74 would gaze in wonder, having seen it, and be delighted in his heart. 
5.75 There he stood, and he began to gaze in wonder, the messenger and slayer of Argus. 
5.76 Nevertheless after he gazed at all these things in his own heart, 
5.77 he then went straightaway into the wide cave. And indeed she did not 
5.78 fail to recognize him, looking him in the face, Calypso, goddess among goddesses: 
5.79 for the gods are not unknown to one another, 
5.80 the immortals, not even if someone lives within a far-away house. 
5.81 But he did not find great-hearted Odysseus inside, 
5.82 as instead that man was crying, sitting on the shore in the very place where he had just as before: 
5.83 through tears and groans and sufferings he was shattering his heart. 
5.84 He would constantly spend his time looking out over the barren sea, pouring forth tears. 
5.85 She began to question Hermes, Calypso, goddess among goddesses, 
5.86 having seated him on a shining, glittering chair: 
5.87 “Why to me, Hermes of the golden wand, have you come- 
5.88 you for whom I have both respect and friendship? Certainly in the past you have not been accustomed to come on account of anything. 
5.89 Express whatever it is you have in mind: my heart orders me to fulfill it- 
5.90 if I am in fact able to fulfill it, and if it is fulfillable. 
5.91 But follow me forth, so that I might place hospitable things beside you. 
5.92 Then, having spoken in this way, the goddess put a table beside him 
5.93 having filled it with ambrosia, and she mixed the dark nectar. 
5.94 He for his part began to drink and eat, the messenger and slayer of Argus; 
5.95 then, after he ate his meal and restored his heart through the food, 
5.96 at that time he spoke to her through words, answering: 
5.97 “You, a goddess, ask me, a god, about my arrival? All right, to you I 
5.98 will truthfully give the message, since you push me to. 
5.99 Zeus was the one who had ordered me, really, to come to this place even though I did not want to. 
5.100 Who, willingly, would wish to run across so much briney water- 
5.101 inexpressibly vast? Nor is there any city of mortal men nearby, they who for the gods 
5.102 Make offerings and desired sacrifices. 
5.103 But after all, it is not at all possible that the design of aegis-holding Zeus 
5.104 another god should either slip past or disappoint. 
5.105 He says that a man is here with you, the most miserable out of all the others 
5.106 of those men who kept fighting all about the city of Priam 
5.107 for nine years, but in the tenth, having plundered the city, went 
5.108 home. But as it happened they got themselves in trouble with Athena on their homeward journey- 
5.109 against them she stirred up both an evil wind and big waves. 
5.110 There on the one hand all the other men died, his good comrades, 
5.111 but that one the driving wind and the waves both brought near to this place. 
5.112 He was the one who had commanded that you send that one away now as quickly as possible- 
5.113 for it is not his fate to die here, far away from his friends. 
5.114 Instead still his fate is both to see his friends and to return 
5.115 to his high-roofed home and to his own fatherland. 
5.116 So he spoke, and Calypso shuddered, goddess among goddesses, 
5.117 and, having spoken winged words, she began to address him: 
5.118 “Cruel are you all, gods, jealous above all others, 
5.119 and you who are spiteful to goddesses that lie in bed beside mortal men 
5.120 as a public affair, if anyone ever makes for herself a dear husband. 
5.121 It was so indeed when rosy-fingered Dawn took Orion for herself- 
5.122 during that time, the gods, living pleasantly, were spiteful towards her- 
5.123 until in Ortygia, pure, golden-throned Artemis 
5.124 with her gentle arrows, approaching, killed him. 
5.125 And it was also so with Iasion when beautiful-haired Demeter, 
5.126 having given way to her heart, joined in love and in a bed 
5.127 of land ploughed three times; and he was not kept in ignorance of this for a long time, 
5.128 Zeus- he killed him, striking with a bright lightning-bolt. 
5.129 And again it is so even now- to me you gods all are spiteful that a mortal man is present. 
5.130 As for him, I was the one who rescued him after he had arrived wrapped around the ship’s keel, 
5.131 alone, since with a bright lightning-bolt his swift ship 
5.132 Zeus squeezed and broke into pieces in the wine-colored mid-sea. 
5.133 There on the one hand all the other good comrades died, 
5.134 but on the other that one the driving wind and the waves both brought near to this place. 
5.135 As for him, I was the one who both was showing affection to, and kept caring for, him, and over and over I told him 
5.136 that I would make him immortal and unaging for all days. 
5.137 But after all, as you say it is not at all possible that the design of aegis-holding Zeus 
5.138 another god should either slip past or disappoint. 
5.139 Fine- let him go, if that god pushes and even orders him, 
5.140 onto the barren sea. But I, for my part you can be sure, will not send him anywhere, 
5.141 for there are no ships equipped with oars near to me, and no comrades 
5.142 who might get him home over the wide back of the sea. 
5.143 All that being said, in good faith I will share advice with him, and I will not hide anything, 
5.144 so that he, quite unhurt, may arrive at his own fatherland. 
5.145 To her in return the messenger and slayer of Argus spoke: 
5.146 “As you say- now send him on his way, and watch yourself against the wrath of Zeus, 
5.147 lest he, having developed a grudge against you in any way, may be harsh afterwards. 
5.148 Having spoken in this way, the mighty slayer of Argus then left. 
5.149 She, the revered nymph, towards great-hearted Odysseus 
5.150 made her way, after she listened to the message of Zeus. 
5.151 She found him sitting on the shore: his two eyes were not ever 
5.152 dry from his tears, and sweet life kept dripping away 
5.153 from him, mourning his return home, since the nymph was not pleasing anymore. 
5.154 But in fact, on one hand, night after night he would always lie by necessity 
5.155 in the hollow caves- he, unwilling, beside her, willing; 
5.156 on the other hand during the days, sitting on the rocks and beaches, 
5.157 through tears, and groans, and sufferings, shattering his heart. 
5.158 He would constantly spend his time looking out over the barren sea, pouring out tears. 
5.159 Coming to a stop nearby, she began to talk to him, goddess among goddesses: 
5.160 “Ill-fated one, do not grieve here with me still, and let your life not 
5.161 waste away: for now, entirely in good faith, I will send you on your way. 
5.162 But come- once you have cut long beams with the bronze ax, join together 
5.163 a wide boat, and then fix for yourself deck-beams on it, 
5.164 so that it may carry you high up over the misty sea. 
5.165 On the other hand, as for me, prepared food and water and red wine 
5.166 I will place within in suitable amounts, which might keep away hunger for you; 
5.167 and I will dress you in clothing, and at your back I will send a helpful wind, 
5.168 so that you quite unhurt might arrive at your own fatherland, 
5.169 if indeed the gods may wish it- those who hold the wide heavens, 
5.170 they are more powerful than me both in design and in execution. 
5.171 So she spoke, and he shuddered, much-suffering godly Odysseus, 
5.172 and, having spoken winged words, he addressed her: 
5.173 “For your part, you certainly are planning something else right now and not sending me on my way in any way, 
5.174 you who command me to cross over the great abyss of the sea on a boat, 
5.175 both terrifying and troubling: over this the well-balanced quick ships do not 
5.176 cross over, taking delight in the helpful wind of Zeus. 
5.177 Nor would I, for my part, set foot on a boat without your support, 
5.178 unless you would be prevailed upon, goddess, to swear for me a great oath, 
5.179 that you will not plan any other evil misery for my own self. 
5.180 So he spoke, and she broke out into a smile, Calypso, goddess among goddesses. 
5.181 She both stroked him with her hand, and began speaking with authority; she called out to him familiarly: 
5.182 “You really are a wicked man, and you know things that are not useless, 
5.183 since you decided to perform a speech like this. 
5.184 Now let the earth know this, and the wide heavens from above, 
5.185 and the rushing-down water of the Styx, which is both the greatest 
5.186 and the most terrifying oath that exists for the blessed gods- 
5.187 that I will not plan any other evil misery for you yourself. 
5.188 But certainly I have these things in mind, and I will consider them, just as that which 
5.189 I might plan for my own self when so great a need may come to me. 
5.190 In fact my mind, you may be sure, is honest, and 
5.191 the heart in my own chest is not iron- instead it is caring. 
5.192 Having spoken in this way, then she, goddess among goddesses, guided him 
5.193 swiftly; he then began to walk along the footsteps of the goddess. 
5.194 They arrived at the hollow cave- the goddess and then also the man- 
5.195 and there he sat down upon the chair from which he had stood up, 
5.196 Hermes, and the nymph began to place beside him all kinds of food, 
5.197 to eat and also to drink- the sort that mortal men eat. 
5.198 She herself began to sit opposite god-like Odysseus, 
5.199 and beside her, servant-women placed ambrosia and nectar. 
5.200 They began to lay their hands on the prepared food set before them. 
5.201 Then, after they enjoyed the food and drink, 
5.202 between them Calypso first began the serious discussion, goddess among goddesses: 
5.203 “Zeus-born son of Laertes, much-inventive Odysseus, 
5.204 in this way, really, homeward to the beloved land that belonged to your fathers- 
5.205 right here and now do you wish to go? But as for you- good luck to you all the same. 
5.206 If only you might know in your gut however many troubles it is the fate assigned to you 
5.207 to fill up, until you arrive in the land that belonged to your fathers; 
5.208 then instead staying right here, you would keep this very house along with me, 
5.209 and you would be immortal, even though longing to see 
5.210 your wife, she whom you always desire each and every day. 
5.211 I can certainly state with confidence that I myself am not inferior to that woman, 
5.212 neither in form nor in stature, since it is not at all fitting 
5.213 that mortal women should compete with immortal women over form and beauty. 
5.214 Answering her, Odysseus of many counsels spoke: 
5.215 “Revered goddess, do not be angry with me in this way: even I myself know 
5.216 all these things entirely- because Penelope, who perceives everything around her, compared to you 
5.217 is inferior to look upon with respect to form and height: 
5.218 for she, on the one hand, is mortal, while on the other hand you are undying and unaging. 
5.219 But even so, I wish and even long each and every day 
5.220 both to go back home and to see for myself my day of return. 
5.221 If any of the gods again should strike on the wine-colored sea, 
5.222 I will endure, having a heart that endures sufferings in my chest- 
5.223 for already I have suffered so very many things, and many things I have struggled through 
5.224 in the waves and in warfare: let also this take its place among those. 
5.225 So he spoke, and the sun sank and dusk came over; 
5.226 going in the farthest corner of the hollow cave, the two 
5.227 began to enjoy themselves in love, remaining beside each other. 
5.228 When early rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, 
5.229 at once he on the one hand put on both a cloak and a tunic, Odysseus, 
5.230 while she herself put on a great shining mantle, the nymph, 
5.231 delicate in weave and graceful, and around her waist she wrapped a belt, 
5.232 beautiful and golden, and a veil on top of her head. 
5.233 Then she began to plan her contribution to the journey for great-hearted Odysseus- 
5.234 she gave to him a great ax, closely fitted in the palms of his hands, 
5.235 made of bronze, sharpened on both sides. Looking more closely, on the ax itself 
5.236 was a handle, very beautiful and made of olive-wood, well-fastened. 
5.237 She gave to him afterwards a carpenter’s ax of polished metal; she began to lead the way 
5.238 over the edge of the island, where the trees had grown tall, 
5.239 alder and black poplar, and also fir, grown as high as the heavens- 
5.240 dry for a long time, well-seasoned- these would float lightly for him. 
5.241 As for her, after she revealed the place where the trees had grown tall, 
5.242 she on the one hand walked towards her house, Calypso, goddess among goddesses, 
5.243 while he began to cut planks for himself- his work was accomplished quickly. 
5.244 Twenty he cut down in total, and then he axed them with bronze, 
5.245 and he smoothed them skillfully, and also straightened them upon a level line. 
5.246 During that time she brought chisels, Calypso, divine of goddesses: 
5.247 he chiseled holes into them all and joined them to each other, 
5.248 and with wooden pegs and fastenings he hammered together that boat. 
5.249 As great as any man might round off the base of a ship- 
5.250 a wide cargo vessel- - well-versed in the practices of a carpenter, 
5.251 so great a size Odysseus built for himself the wide boat upon this. 
5.252 Having raised the deck-platform, fitting them to the close-set ribs, 
5.253 he continued building- and then he began finishing by means of the long gunwale planks. 
5.254 Then he began building a mast and yard-arm, fastened onto it. 
5.255 Then also he built for himself a rudder, so that he could steer. 
5.256 He fortified it thoroughly with willow wicker-work, 
5.257 so that it would be a defense from the waves; he heaped up for himself much brush. 
5.258 During that time, she brought textiles- Calypso, divine of goddesses- 
5.259 to make for himself a sail; those things too he crafted for himself skillfully. 
5.260 The sails’ upper braces and the cables and the sails’ feet he tied in on the ship itself, 
5.261 and with levers he then hauled her into the divine sea. 
5.262 It was the fourth day when all things had been completed by him; 
5.263 then on the fifth she had him begin his journey from the island, divine Calypso, 
5.264 having clothed him in sweet-smelling robes and having bathed him. 
5.265 Within the goddess placed for him a leather container- of dark wine, 
5.266 this one- and another large one of water, and also food in 
5.267 a leather sack: inside she was packing many strength-giving cooked meats for him. 
5.268 She sent forward a favorable wind, both gentle and warm. 
5.269 Filled with happiness, god-like Odysseus opened wide his sails to the wind. 
5.270 He then began to steer himself with the rudder with practiced skill, 
5.271 having taken his seat. Nor did sleep ever fall upon his eyelids, 
5.272 looking over the Pleiads, and after a long time the sinking Bootes, 
5.273 and the Great Bear- which also they call by another name, the wagon, 
5.274 and she who both circles around herself in that spot and also watches Orion. 
5.275 She alone has no share of the cleansing waters of Oceanus; 
5.276 Regarding this constellation, in fact, Calypso, goddess among goddesses, had ordered that he 
5.277 pass over the sea while keeping it on the left side of his hand. 
5.278 At first, for seven and ten days he kept sailing, passing over the sea, 
5.279 but then on the eighteenth day shadowy mountains were visible 
5.280 of Phaeacian land, where it was nearest to him: 
5.281 it was visible just like a skin on the misty sea. 
5.282 But that man the ruling Earth-shaker, coming back from the Ethiopians, 
5.283 saw from far away, out of the mountains of the Solymi- for he was seen by him, 
5.284 as he sailed over the sea. And he became even more greatly angered in his heart, 
5.285 shaking his head- he deliberated with his own spirit: 
5.286 “Are you kidding me? Surely the gods greatly changed their plans in a different direction 
5.287 regarding Odysseus, while I was among the Ethiopians. 
5.288 And now he is near the land of the Phaeacians; there his lot 
5.289 is to escape the great fated share of suffering which comes upon him. 
5.290 All the same I insist that I will in fact still drive him towards his fill of hardship. 
5.291 Having spoken thus, he began to drive together the clouds, and he stirred up the sea 
5.292 after seizing his trident with his hands: he began to rouse all the gusts 
5.293 of every kind of wind, and with the clouds he covered over 
5.294 the land and the sea at once- and night had come down from heaven. 
5.295 At once both the East Wind and South Wind came crashing down, and the stormy West Wind, 
5.296 and also the North Wind, born from ether, rolling a great wave. 
5.297 Then the knees of Odysseus and his dear heart gave out, 
5.298 and, agitated, he spoke to his great-hearted spirit: 
5.299 “Oh me, for my part I am miserable- what now might finally happen to me? 
5.300 I dread that all the things the goddess said are correct: 
5.301 she stated that on the sea, before I return to the land that belonged to my fathers, 
5.302 I will have my fill of suffering- and now all these things are being fulfilled. 
5.303 With such clouds he encircles the wide heavens, 
5.304 Zeus, and he stirred the sea; and they rage on, the gusts 
5.305 of winds of all kinds. Now steep death is certain for me. 
5.306 Three times blessed are the Danaans- even four times- who were lost then 
5.307 in wide Troy, bringing happiness to the sons of Atreus. 
5.308 So I, for my part, ought to have died and met my fate 
5.309 on that day when at me the greatest number cast bronze-covered spears, 
5.310 the Trojans, around the son of Peleus after he died. 
5.311 In that case I would have had my share of funeral gifts, and the Achaeans would have maintained my own fame; 
5.312 but it had been fated for me to be taken now by miserable death. 
5.313 Then, thus speaking, a great wave struck him down from above, 
5.314 rushing in a way that struck him with terror, and it whirled around all about the boat. 
5.315 As for him, far away from the boat he fell, and the rudder 
5.316 he dropped from his hands; it shattered his mast in the middle, 
5.317 the terrifying storm that had come from the winds, mixing with one another, 
5.318 and far away the sail and yard-arm fell in the sea. 
5.319 It held him underwater for a long time, and he was not able 
5.320 at first to completely get up from under the surge of the great wave: 
5.321 for the clothes kept weighing him down, those which divine Calypso provided him. 
5.322 After a long time he rose to the surface, and he spat saltwater out of his mouth- 
5.323 the bitter saltwater, which gurgled from his head in great amounts. 
5.324 Even so, he was not forgetful of the boat, however worn-out he was, 
5.325 and instead he, lunging after it in the waves, took hold of it for himself; 
5.326 he sat down in its middle, avoiding the fulfillment of his own death. 
5.327 A great wave repeatedly carried along this boat down the current, this way and that way. 
5.328 And as when in late summer the North Wind may carry along thistles 
5.329 over a plain, and they cling close beside one another, 
5.330 so did the winds keep carrying the boat over the sea, this way and that way: 
5.331 now, on one hand, the South Wind would toss it over to the North Wind to be carried- 
5.332 then, on the other hand, again the East Wind would yield to the West Wind to propel it. 
5.333 But she saw him- the daughter of Cadmus, beautiful-ankled Ino, 
5.334 Leukothea (the white goddess), she who was previously mortal and used human speech, 
5.335 but now in the seas of brine she had received the position of rank from the gods. 
5.336 That woman took pity on wandering Odysseus, possessing sufferings. 
5.337 Like a seagull in flight she lifted herself out of the sea, 
5.338 and she sat down on the boat with many fastenings, and she spoke a command: 
5.339 “Ill-fated one, why to this degree has Poseidon the Earthshaker 
5.340 gotten himself into a fury violently, that for you he plants the seeds of many evil things? 
5.341 Indeed he will not destroy you, however much he is worked up. 
5.342 Instead, act much in this way- you seem to me not to be stupid: 
5.343 taking off those clothes, leave the boat to be carried by the winds- 
5.344 instead, swimming with your hands, grasp your homecoming- 
5.345 the land of the Phaeacians, where your fate is to escape. 
5.346 Here- drape this headscarf beneath your chest, 
5.347 this headscarf, the kind that immortals wear: for you there is no fear of suffering anything or dying. 
5.348 However, when you take hold of the mainland with your hands, 
5.349 having loosened it from yourself in order to cast it back again into the wine-colored sea, 
5.350 very far from the mainland- and as for you, turn yourself away- far away. 
5.351 Having spoken in this way, the goddess then gave the headscarf 
5.352 and she herself sank back into the swelling sea 
5.353 like a seagull- and a dark wave concealed her. 
5.354 Meanwhile, for his part, the much-suffering, godlike Odysseus, he pondered. 
5.355 Agitated, he then spoke to his own great-hearted spirit: 
5.356 “Oh me, I fear that one of the immortals is weaving a trap for me again, 
5.357 that she orders me to get away from the boat. 
5.358 Instead I will most definitely not follow her directions immediately, since far out I, for my part, see with my own eyes 
5.359 land, where she said that there is a chance of escape for me. 
5.360 Instead I will most definitely do it this way- this seems to be the best for me. 
5.361 So long as the beams should remain joined together in their joints, 
5.362 so long I will remain right here, and I will endure, suffering hardships. 
5.363 But then when a wave should smash my boat apart, 
5.364 I will swim, since it really is not possible to plan out ahead of time anything better. 
5.365 While he was turning these things over through his heart and also through his spirit, 
5.366 Poseidon the Earth-shaker sent surging in his direction a great wave, 
5.367 both terrifying and harsh, arching over the boat. It drove Odysseus himself. 
5.368 Like a stormy wind might rattle a pile of dried husks- 
5.369 these it scatters, some in one direction, and some in another- 
5.370 just so it scattered the long beams of the boat. As for him, Odysseus, 
5.371 he straddled one beam as if driving a race-horse, 
5.372 and he started to take off the clothes, those which divine Calypso handed to him. 
5.373 Immediately he draped the headscarf below his chest, 
5.374 and he himself fell face-first down in the sea, having spread out his two hands, 
5.375 doing everything in his power to swim. The ruling Earth-shaker saw, 
5.376 shaking his head- he deliberated with his own spirit: 
5.377 “Like this now, having suffered many evils, wander down through the sea, 
5.378 until, into that place, you may have dealings with people tended to by Zeus. 
5.379 But even so I do not suppose that you will make light of this hardship. 
5.380 Then, having spoken in this way, he whipped his beautiful-maned horses, 
5.381 and he arrived in Aegae, where his famous homes are. 
5.382 But for her part, Athena, the daughter of Zeus, had in her mind other things. 
5.383 In fact she tied down the paths of the other winds, 
5.384 and she commanded all of them together to stop what they were doing, and to put themselves at rest: 
5.385 she stirred up upon him the quick North Wind, and before him she beat the waves down, 
5.386 so that he might have dealings with the oar-loving Phaeacians- 
5.387 Zeus-born Odysseus, having escaped death and also fate. 
5.388 There through two nights and two days he was constantly buffeted by the strong swell, 
5.389 and many times his heart kept anticipating his destruction. 
5.390 But when beautiful-haired Dawn brought the third day to pass, 
5.391 at that point afterwards the wind stopped, and a calm, 
5.392 windless, began: and so he caught sight of land nearby, 
5.393 especially sharp-eyed, having looked out, and having been lifted up from under a great wave. 
5.394 And as when the hoped-for life of their father might appear to children, 
5.395 he who lies in sickness, suffering harsh pains, 
5.396 wasting away for a long time- a hateful spirit had been having its way with him. 
5.397 But then indeed the gods free him, hoped for, from the evil- 
5.398 even so hoped-for to Odysseus both the land and the forest appeared. 
5.399 And he kept swimming, scrambling to step upon the mainland with his feet. 
5.400 Yet when he was as far away as a man can make himself heard by shouting, 
5.401 then he heard the crash of the sea against the rocks, 
5.402 for the great wave kept roaring against the coast of the mainland, 
5.403 spewing terribly, and all things had been cloaked by the foam of the sea. 
5.404 For there were no secure harbors of ships, nor any places of shelter; 
5.405 instead there were jutting coasts, as well as rocks and cliffs. 
5.406 And then the knees and beloved heart of Odysseus gave way, 
5.407 and he, agitated, spoke to his own great-hearted spirit: 
5.408 “Oh me, as soon as he gave me the ability to see land that I had not dared to hope for, 
5.409 Zeus, and I, by cutting through, crossed this gulf- 
5.410 no escape out of the gray sea is in any way visible. 
5.411 For outside there are sharp cliffs, and on both sides a wave, 
5.412 rushing, wails, and a smooth rock rose up. 
5.413 The sea is even deep near the shore; it is not at all possible 
5.414 to stand on both feet and to run away from this hardship- 
5.415 I fear that in some way it would throw me, making my way out, against the hard rock, 
5.416 the great wave, having seized me- and my attempt will be in vain. 
5.417 But if I will swim along still farther, somewhere I would find 
5.418 both shelving beaches and inlets from the sea- 
5.419 but I fear that a squall, having snatched me up once again, 
5.420 will carry me, groaning deeply, over the fish-filled sea. 
5.421 Or even that a god might send against me some great beast of the sea 
5.422 from out of the deep: renowned Amphitrite nourishes many of this sort. 
5.423 For I know how much the renowned Earth-shaker has been angered at me. 
5.424 As he kept turning over these things through his heart and through his spirit, 
5.425 meanwhile a great wave began to carry him toward the rocky coast. 
5.426 There he would have had his skin stripped away and his bones smashed together, 
5.427 if the goddess, silvery-eyed Athena, had not placed this into his thoughts: 
5.428 and with a rush he took hold of the rock with both his hands. 
5.429 He kept holding on to that rock, groaning, until the great wave passed by. 
5.430 And at first he escaped this in this way, but then, surging back again, 
5.431 it struck him with a rush, and threw him far into the sea. 
5.432 As when an octopus is being pulled from its den, 
5.433 pebbles stick to its closely-packed suckers, 
5.434 so from the bold hands of that one onto the rocks 
5.435 his skin was ripped off: and the great wave covered him. 
5.436 There for sure miserable Odysseus would have been lost, outside the boundary of his fate, 
5.437 if she had not given him presence of mind, silvery-eyed Athena. 
5.438 Having emerged from the wave, which spews forth towards the mainland, 
5.439 he began swimming out along the shore, looking out into the land in the hopes that somewhere he might find 
5.440 both shelving beaches and inlets from the sea. 
5.441 But when, down along the mouth of a beautifully-flowing river 
5.442 he arrived, swimming, here indeed the land seemed best to him, 
5.443 as it was smooth of rocks, and even a shelter from the wind besides. 
5.444 He recognized the river, flowing out, and prayed according to his own spirit: 
5.445 “Listen to me, lord, whoever you are: I come to you, one addressed by many suppliants, 
5.446 having fled the abuse of Poseidon out of the sea. 
5.447 Any man is an object of respect- even to the undying gods- 
5.448 whoever of all the men arrives, wandering, just as I, for my part, now 
5.449 arrive at both your current and your knees, having worked my way through so many things. 
5.450 Just take pity, lord: I formally assert that I am your suppliant. 
5.451 He said this, and immediately that god put a stop to his current and held back the waves, 
5.452 and he made a calm before him, and he saved him 
5.453 into the mouth of the river. That man then bent both his knees 
5.454 and his strong hands- for his dear heart had been overcome by the sea. 
5.455 All his flesh was swollen, while much seawater kept gushing 
5.456 up through both his mouth and nose. He, breathless and speechless, 
5.457 was lying down with feeble strength, and brutal exhaustion began to reach him. 
5.458 But when he caught his breath, and his spirit was collected into his heart, 
5.459 then he untied the headscarf of the goddess from him 
5.460 and let it go into the river that flows into the sea; 
5.461 the great wave began to carry it back again down along the current, and quickly Ino then 
5.462 received it in her dear hands. He, withdrawing out of the river, 
5.463 lay down under the reeds, and he kissed the fertile soil. 
5.464 Agitated, he then spoke to his great-hearted spirit: 
5.465 “Oh me, what may I suffer? Now what may befall me next? 
5.466 If, on the one hand, I keep watch in this riverbed throughout the hard night, 
5.467 I fear that both the evil frost and fresh dew together 
5.468 might be the end of me, having given my final breath, as a result of my weakened condition- 
5.469 a freezing breeze from the river blows before dawn. 
5.470 On the other hand, if, having gone up into the hillside and shady forest, 
5.471 I should fall asleep in the dense bushes- assuming that they might allow me, 
5.472 the cold and exhaustion and that sweet sleep might come upon me- 
5.473 I fear that I may become prey and a find for wild predators. 
5.474 So this seemed to be more profitable to him, as he pondered: 
5.475 he went to go into the forest, which he found near the water 
5.476 in a visible place. He then went under two bushes, 
5.477 which had grown out of the same spot- while this one was of thorn wood, the other was of olive wood. 
5.478 Certainly through these neither the damp force of the gusty winds would blow, 
5.479 nor would the shining sun ever strike with its beams, 
5.480 nor would the rain ever pass through: so dense 
5.481 they had grown, tangled up with each other. Under these Odysseus 
5.482 lowered himself. Immediately he piled up a bed for himself with his dear hands- 
5.483 a wide one, for the heap of leaves was very much sufficient, 
5.484 as great as would be needed to protect either two or three men 
5.485 in the winter season, even if it might be especially severe. 
5.486 Having seen this he rejoiced, the much-suffering godlike Odysseus, 
5.487 and then in the middle he laid himself; he piled over himself a heap of leaves. 
5.488 Like when someone buries a piece of burning wood in dark ashes 
5.489 at the borderland of the field, near to which there are no other neighbors, 
5.490 preserving the seed of fire so that he would not need to get light from some other place, 
5.491 so did Odysseus cover himself in leaves. Athena then 
5.492 began to pour sleep upon his eyes, so that it, swiftly, might cause him to leave off 
5.493 from laborious trouble, having covered over his dear eyelids.
