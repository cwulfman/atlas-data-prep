1		TIINA (tears turn into blazing anger): What do you want from me! You consider yourselves humans, but you are worse than predatory animals! You call me a werewolf? - Yes, I am, because you don't want anything else! Better a thousand times a wolf, a wolf in the midst of wolves, than a human who is no better than you! A wolf kills only out of hunger, and - a wolf doesn't kill another wolf, but you do!... And you think yourselves better than me? Here - a wolf, proud, doesn't allow itself to be shamed! But you - covered in the shame of slavery, you grovel behind fences like dogs! A wolf is free, does what it wants, comes when it wants, leaves when it wants, loves and hates whom it wants! And it leaves from among you, because it - despises you! (She strides proudly towards the forest, no one stops her, everyone is as if frozen.)
2		(In the forest, small flickering lights appear here and there in the darkness, like the eyes of a wolf, which immediately disappear again.)
3		(Then from the midst of this silence):
4		OLDER MAN: Holy God! The Midsummer fire extinguished! This does not bode well!
5		OLDER WOMAN: And the forest so dark and eerie! One surely dare not stay here anymore!
6		(Arising fear among the people, girls and women gather together in a heap, children cling to the clothes of the elders. Murmuring and lamenting, some start to leave, gradually everyone disappears. Only Margus remains by the smoldering fire; his troubled state shows that he is struggling with dark thoughts. - Standing apart are the Tammaru master and mistress, who are angry and speaking fiercely with each other, their conversation gradually becoming audible.)
7		MASTER (gesturing helplessly): Well, tell me!.. What are you going to do with that fool!
8		MISTRESS: The girl should have been sent away long ago!
9		MASTER: Well, send her away then! But how do you suddenly drive her away? But there's no other way! Who would have believed that she - (gesturing helplessly) doesn't care about her benefactors and won't leave my son alone!
10		MISTRESS: Still a wolf, what a wolf! What she said to the people!
11		MASTER (threateningly): She better come back!
12		MISTRESS (approaching Margus): Are you coming back too?
13		MARGUS (plaintively): How can I come back, when you saw that... she ran away and who knows what she'll do!
14		MISTRESS (mercilessly): She won't do anything!
15		MASTER (mockingly): Maybe you want to run after her into the forest too?
16		MARGUS (anxiously): Where would I know to go after her!
