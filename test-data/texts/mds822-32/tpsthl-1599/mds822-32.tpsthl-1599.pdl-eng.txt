1.1 Come live with mee and be my love,
1.2 And we will all the pleasures prove,
1.3 That Vallies, groves, hills and fieldes,
1.4 Woods, or steepie mountaine yeeldes.

2.4 Melodious byrds sing Madrigalls.

3.2 And a thousand fragrant posies,

4.2 Which from our pretty Lambes we pull,
4.3 Fayre lined slippers for the cold:
4.4 With buckles of the purest gold.
5.1 A belt of straw, and Ivie buds,
5.2 With Corall clasps and Amber studs,
5.3 And if these pleasures may thee move,
5.4 Come live with mee, and be my love.
6.1 The Sheepheards Swaines shall daunce and sing,
6.2 For thy delight each May-morning.
6.3 If these delights thy minde may move;
6.4 Then live with mee, and be my love.
