1.0.0	ACT I
1.1.1	Venice. A street. 
1.1.2	Enter RODERIGO and IAGO.
1.1.3	Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly 
1.1.4	That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse 
1.1.5	As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this. 
1.1.6	'Sblood, but you will not hear me: 
1.1.7	If ever I did dream of such a matter, 
1.1.8	Abhor me. 
1.1.9	Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate. 
1.1.10	Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city, 
1.1.11	In personal suit to make me his lieutenant, 
1.1.12	Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man, 
1.1.13	I know my price, I am worth no worse a place: 
1.1.14	But he, as loving his own pride and purposes, 
1.1.15	Evades them, with a bombast circumstance 
1.1.16	Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war; 
1.1.17	And, in conclusion, 
1.1.18	Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he, 
1.1.19	'I have already chose my officer.' 
1.1.20	And what was he? 
1.1.21	Forsooth, a great arithmetician, 
1.1.22	One Michael Cassio, a Florentine, 
1.1.23	A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife; 
1.1.24	That never set a squadron in the field, 
1.1.25	Nor the division of a battle knows 
1.1.26	More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric, 
1.1.27	Wherein the toged consuls can propose 
1.1.28	As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practice, 
1.1.29	Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election: 
1.1.30	And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof 
1.1.31	At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds 
1.1.32	Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd 
1.1.33	By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster, 
1.1.34	He, in good time, must his lieutenant be, 
1.1.35	And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient. 
1.1.36	By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman. 
1.1.37	Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service, 
1.1.38	Preferment goes by letter and affection, 
1.1.39	And not by old gradation, where each second 
1.1.40	Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself, 
1.1.41	Whether I in any just term am affined 
1.1.42	To love the Moor. 
1.1.43	I would not follow him then. 
1.1.44	O, sir, content you; 
1.1.45	I follow him to serve my turn upon him: 
1.1.46	We cannot all be masters, nor all masters 
1.1.47	Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark 
1.1.48	Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave, 
1.1.49	That, doting on his own obsequious bondage, 
1.1.50	Wears out his time, much like his master's ass, 
1.1.51	For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd: 
1.1.52	Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are 
1.1.53	Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty, 
1.1.54	Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves, 
1.1.55	And, throwing but shows of service on their lords, 
1.1.56	Do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats 
1.1.57	Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul; 
1.1.58	And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir, 
1.1.59	It is as sure as you are Roderigo, 
1.1.60	Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago: 
1.1.61	In following him, I follow but myself; 
1.1.62	Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty, 
1.1.63	But seeming so, for my peculiar end: 
1.1.64	For when my outward action doth demonstrate 
1.1.65	The native act and figure of my heart 
1.1.66	In compliment extern, 'tis not long after 
1.1.67	But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve 
1.1.68	For daws to peck at: I am not what I am. 
1.1.69	What a full fortune does the thicklips owe, 
1.1.70	If he can carry't thus! 
1.1.71	Call up her father, 
1.1.72	Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight, 
1.1.73	Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen, 
1.1.74	And, though he in a fertile climate dwell, 
1.1.75	Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy, 
1.1.76	Yet throw such changes of vexation on't, 
1.1.77	As it may lose some color. 
1.1.78	Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud. 
1.1.79	Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell 
1.1.80	As when, by night and negligence, the fire 
1.1.81	Is spied in populous cities. 
1.1.82	What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho! 
1.1.83	Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves! 
1.1.84	Look to your house, your daughter and your bags! 
1.1.85	Thieves! thieves! BRABANTIO appears above, at a window. 
1.1.86	What is the reason of this terrible summons? 
1.1.87	What is the matter there? 
1.1.88	Signior, is all your family within? 
1.1.89	Are your doors lock'd? 
1.1.90	Why, wherefore ask you this? 
1.1.91	'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on your gown; 
1.1.92	Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul; 
1.1.93	Even now, now, very now, an old black ram 
1.1.94	Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise; 
1.1.95	Awake the snorting citizens with the bell, 
1.1.96	Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you: 
1.1.97	Arise, I say. 
1.1.98	What, have you lost your wits? 
1.1.99	Most reverend signior, do you know my voice? 
1.1.100	Not I: what are you? 
1.1.101	My name is Roderigo. 
1.1.102	The worser welcome: 
1.1.103	I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors: 
1.1.104	In honest plainness thou hast heard me say 
1.1.105	My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness, 
1.1.106	Being full of supper and distempering draughts, 
1.1.107	Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come 
1.1.108	To start my quiet. 
1.1.109	Sir, sir, sir,-- 
1.1.110	But thou must needs be sure 
1.1.111	My spirit and my place have in them power 
1.1.112	To make this bitter to thee. 
1.1.113	Patience, good sir. 
1.1.114	What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice; 
1.1.115	My house is not a grange. 
1.1.116	Most grave Brabantio, 
1.1.117	In simple and pure soul I come to you. 
1.1.118	'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse; you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans. 
1.1.119	What profane wretch art thou? 
1.1.120	I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs. 
1.1.121	Thou art a villain. 
1.1.122	You are--a senator. 
1.1.123	This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo. 
1.1.124	Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you, 
1.1.125	If 't be your pleasure and most wise consent, 
1.1.126	As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter, 
1.1.127	At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night, 
1.1.128	Transported, with no worse nor better guard 
1.1.129	But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier, 
1.1.130	To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor,-- 
1.1.131	If this be known to you and your allowance, 
1.1.132	We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs; 
1.1.133	But if you know not this, my manners tell me 
1.1.134	We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe 
1.1.135	That, from the sense of all civility, 
1.1.136	I thus would play and trifle with your reverence: 
1.1.137	Your daughter, if you have not given her leave, 
1.1.138	I say again, hath made a gross revolt; 
1.1.139	Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes 
1.1.140	In an extravagant and wheeling stranger 
1.1.141	Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself: 
1.1.142	If she be in her chamber or your house, 
1.1.143	Let loose on me the justice of the state 
1.1.144	For thus deluding you. 
1.1.145	Strike on the tinder, ho! 
1.1.146	Give me a taper! call up all my people! 
1.1.147	This accident is not unlike my dream: 
1.1.148	Belief of it oppresses me already. 
1.1.149	Light, I say! light! [Exit above. 
1.1.150	Farewell; for I must leave you: 
1.1.151	It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place, 
1.1.152	To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall-- 
1.1.153	Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state, 
1.1.154	However this may gall him with some check, 
1.1.155	Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd 
1.1.156	With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars, 
1.1.157	Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls, 
1.1.158	Another of his fathom they have none, 
1.1.159	To lead their business: in which regard, 
1.1.160	Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains, 
1.1.161	Yet, for necessity of present life, 
1.1.162	I must show out a flag and sign of love, 
1.1.163	Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him, 
1.1.164	Lead to the Sagittary the raised search; 
1.1.165	And there will I be with him. So, farewell. [Exit. Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches. 
1.1.166	It is too true an evil: gone she is; 
1.1.167	And what's to come of my despised time 
1.1.168	Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo, 
1.1.169	Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl! 
1.1.170	With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father! 
1.1.171	How didst thou know 'twas she? O, she deceives me 
1.1.172	Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers: 
1.1.173	Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you? 
1.1.174	Truly, I think they are. 
1.1.175	O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood! 
1.1.176	Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds 
1.1.177	By what you see them act. Is there not charms 
1.1.178	By which the property of youth and maidhood 
1.1.179	May he abused? Have you not read, Roderigo, 
1.1.180	Of some such thing? 
1.1.181	Yes, sir, I have indeed. 
1.1.182	Call up my brother. O, would you had had her! 
1.1.183	Some one way, some another. Do you know 
1.1.184	Where we may apprehend her and the Moor? 
1.1.185	I think I can discover him, if you please 
1.1.186	To get good guard and go along with me. 
1.1.187	Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call; 
1.1.188	I may command at most. Get weapons, ho! 
1.1.189	And raise some special officers of night. 
1.1.190	On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains. [Exeunt. 
1.2.1	Another street. 
1.2.2	Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches.
1.2.3	Though in the trade of war I have slain men, 
1.2.4	Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience 
1.2.5	To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity 
1.2.6	Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times 
1.2.7	I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs. 
1.2.8	'Tis better as it is. 
1.2.9	Nay, but he prated, 
1.2.10	And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms 
1.2.11	Against your honor 
1.2.12	That, with the little godliness I have, 
1.2.13	I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir, 
1.2.14	Are you fast married? Be assured of this, 
1.2.15	That the magnifico is much beloved, 
1.2.16	And hath in his effect a voice potential 
1.2.17	As double as the duke's: he will divorce you; 
1.2.18	Or put upon you what restraint and grievance 
1.2.19	The law, with all his might to enforce it on, 
1.2.20	Will give him cable. 
1.2.21	Let him do his spite; 
1.2.22	My services which I have done the signiory 
1.2.23	Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,-- 
1.2.24	Which, when I know that boasting is an honor, 
1.2.25	I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being 
1.2.26	>From men of royal siege, and my demerits 
1.2.27	May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune 
1.2.28	As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago, 
1.2.29	But that I love the gentle Desdemona, 
1.2.30	I would not my unhoused free condition 
1.2.31	Put into circumscription and confine 
1.2.32	For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond? 
1.2.33	Those are the raised father and his friends: 
1.2.34	You were best go in. 
1.2.35	Not I; I must be found: 
1.2.36	My parts, my title and my perfect soul 
1.2.37	Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they? 
1.2.38	By Janus, I think no. Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches. 
1.2.39	The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant. 
1.2.40	The goodness of the night upon you, friends! 
1.2.41	What is the news? 
1.2.42	The duke does greet you, general, 
1.2.43	And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance, 
1.2.44	Even on the instant. 
1.2.45	What is the matter, think you? 
1.2.46	Something from Cyprus, as I may divine: 
1.2.47	It is a business of some heat: the galleys 
1.2.48	Have sent a dozen sequent messengers 
1.2.49	This very night at one another's heels, 
1.2.50	And many of the consuls raised and met, 
1.2.51	Are at the duke's already: you have been hotly call'd for; 
1.2.52	When, being not at your lodging to be found, 
1.2.53	The senate hath sent about three several quests 
1.2.54	To search you out. 
1.2.55	'Tis well I am found by you. 
1.2.56	I will but spend a word here in the house, 
1.2.57	And go with you. [Exit. 
1.2.58	Ancient, what makes he here? 
1.2.59	'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack: 
1.2.60	If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever. 
1.2.61	I do not understand. 
1.2.62	He's married. 
1.2.63	To who? Re-enter OTHELLO. 
1.2.64	Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go? 
1.2.65	Have with you. 
1.2.66	Here comes another troop to seek for you. 
1.2.67	It is Brabantio. General, be advised; 
1.2.68	He comes to bad intent. Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weapons. 
1.2.69	Holla! stand there! 
1.2.70	Signior, it is the Moor. 
1.2.71	Down with him, thief! [They draw on both sides. 
1.2.72	You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you. 
1.2.73	Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them. 
1.2.74	Good signior, you shall more command with years 
1.2.75	Than with your weapons. 
1.2.76	O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter? 
1.2.77	Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her; 
1.2.78	For I'll refer me to all things of sense, 
1.2.79	If she in chains of magic were not bound, 
1.2.80	Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy, 
1.2.81	So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd 
1.2.82	The wealthy curled darlings of our nation, 
1.2.83	Would ever have, to incur a general mock, 
1.2.84	Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom 
1.2.85	Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight. 
1.2.86	Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense 
1.2.87	That thou hast practised on her with foul charms, 
1.2.88	Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals 
1.2.89	That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on; 
1.2.90	'Tis probable and palpable to thinking. 
1.2.91	I therefore apprehend and do attach thee 
1.2.92	For an abuser of the world, a practiser 
1.2.93	Of arts inhibited and out of warrant. 
1.2.94	Lay hold upon him: if he do resist, 
1.2.95	Subdue him at his peril. 
1.2.96	Hold your hands, 
1.2.97	Both you of my inclining, and the rest: 
1.2.98	Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it 
1.2.99	Without a prompter. Where will you that I go 
1.2.100	To answer this your charge? 
1.2.101	To prison, till fit time 
1.2.102	Of law and course of direct session 
1.2.103	Call thee to answer. 
1.2.104	What if I do obey? 
1.2.105	How may the duke be therewith satisfied, 
1.2.106	Whose messengers are here about my side, 
1.2.107	Upon some present business of the state 
1.2.108	To bring me to him?
1.2.109	'Tis true, most worthy signior; 
1.2.110	The duke's in council, and your noble self, 
1.2.111	I am sure, is sent for. 
1.2.112	How! the duke in council! 
1.2.113	In this time of the night! Bring him away: 
1.2.114	Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself, 
1.2.115	Or any of my brothers of the state, 
1.2.116	Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own; 
1.2.117	For if such actions may have passage free, 
1.2.118	Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be. [Exeunt. 
1.3.1	A council-chamber. The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending. 
1.3.2	There is no composition in these news 
1.3.3	That gives them credit. 
1.3.4	Indeed, they are disproportion'd; 
1.3.5	My letters say a hundred and seven galleys. 
1.3.6	And mine, a hundred and forty. 
1.3.7	And mine, two hundred: 
1.3.8	But though they jump not on a just account,-- 
1.3.9	As in these cases, where the aim reports, 
1.3.10	'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm 
1.3.11	A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus. 
1.3.12	Nay, it is possible enough to judgement: 
1.3.13	I do not so secure me in the error, 
1.3.14	But the main articles I do approve 
1.3.15	In fearful sense. 
1.3.16	[Within] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho! 
1.3.17	A messenger from the galleys. Enter a Sailor. 
1.3.18	Now, what's the business? 
1.3.19	The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes; 
1.3.20	So was I bid report here to the state 
1.3.21	By Signior Angelo. 
1.3.22	How say you by this change? 
1.3.23	This cannot be, 
1.3.24	By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant, 
1.3.25	To keep us in false gaze. When we consider 
1.3.26	The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk, 
1.3.27	And let ourselves again but understand, 
1.3.28	That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes, 
1.3.29	So may he with more facile question bear it, 
1.3.30	For that it stands not in such warlike brace, 
1.3.31	But altogether lacks the abilities 
1.3.32	That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this, 
1.3.33	We must not think the Turk is so unskilful 
1.3.34	To leave that latest which concerns him first, 
1.3.35	Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain, 
1.3.36	To wake and wage a danger profitless. 
1.3.37	Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes. 
1.3.38	Here is more news. Enter a Messenger. 
1.3.39	The Ottomites, reverend and gracious, 
1.3.40	Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes, 
1.3.41	Have there injointed them with an after fleet. 
1.3.42	 Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess? 
1.3.43	 Of thirty sail: and now they do re-stem 
1.3.44	Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance 
1.3.45	Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano, 
1.3.46	Your trusty and most valiant servitor, 
1.3.47	With his free duty recommends you thus, 
1.3.48	And prays you to believe him. 
1.3.49	'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus. 
1.3.50	Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town? 
1.3.51	He's now in Florence. 
1.3.52	Write from us to him; post-posthaste dispatch. 
1.3.53	Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor. Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers. 
1.3.54	Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you 
1.3.55	Against the general enemy Ottoman. 
1.3.56	[To Brabantio] I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior; 
1.3.57	We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight. 
1.3.58	So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me; 
1.3.59	Neither my place nor aught I heard of business 
1.3.60	Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care 
1.3.61	Take hold on me, for my particular grief 
1.3.62	Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature 
1.3.63	That it engluts and swallows other sorrows 
1.3.64	And it is still itself. 
1.3.65	Why, what's the matter? 
1.3.66	My daughter! O, my daughter! 
1.3.67	Dead? 
1.3.68	Ay, to me; 
1.3.69	She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted 
1.3.70	By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks; 
1.3.71	For nature so preposterously to err, 
1.3.72	Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense, 
1.3.73	Sans witchcraft could not. 
1.3.74	Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding 
1.3.75	Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself 
1.3.76	And you of her, the bloody book of law 
1.3.77	You shall yourself read in the bitter letter 
1.3.78	After your own sense, yea, though our proper son 
1.3.79	Stood in your action. 
1.3.80	Humbly I thank your grace. 
1.3.81	Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems, 
1.3.82	Your special mandate for the state-affairs 
1.3.83	Hath hither brought. 
1.3.84	We are very sorry for 't. 
1.3.85	[To Othello] What, in your own part, can you say to this? 
1.3.86	Nothing, but this is so. 
1.3.87	Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, 
1.3.88	My very noble and approved good masters, 
1.3.89	That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter, 
1.3.90	It is most true; true, I have married her: 
1.3.91	The very head and front of my offending 
1.3.92	Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech, 
1.3.93	And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace; 
1.3.94	For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith. 
1.3.95	Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used 
1.3.96	Their dearest action in the tented field, 
1.3.97	And little of this great world can I speak, 
1.3.98	More than pertains to feats of broil and battle, 
1.3.99	And therefore little shall I grace my cause 
1.3.100	In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience, 
1.3.101	I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver 
1.3.102	Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms, 
1.3.103	What conjuration and what mighty magic, 
1.3.104	For such proceeding I am charged withal, 
1.3.105	I won his daughter. 
1.3.106	A maiden never bold; 
1.3.107	Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion 
1.3.108	Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature, 
1.3.109	Of years, of country, credit, every thing, 
1.3.110	To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on! 
1.3.111	It is a judgement maim'd and most imperfect 
1.3.112	That will confess perfection so could err 
1.3.113	Against all rules of nature, and must be driven 
1.3.114	To find out practices of cunning hell, 
1.3.115	Why this should be. I therefore vouch again 
1.3.116	That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood, 
1.3.117	Or with some dram conjured to this effect, 
1.3.118	He wrought upon her. 
1.3.119	To vouch this, is no proof, 
1.3.120	Without more wider and more overt test 
1.3.121	Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods 
1.3.122	Of modern seeming do prefer against him. 
1.3.123	First Sen. But, Othello, speak: 
1.3.124	Did you by indirect and forced courses 
1.3.125	Subdue and poison this young maid's affections? 
1.3.126	Or came it by request and such fair question 
1.3.127	As soul to soul affordeth? 
1.3.128	I do beseech you, 
1.3.129	Send for the lady to the Sagittary, 
1.3.130	And let her speak of me before her father: 
1.3.131	If you do find me foul in her report, 
1.3.132	The trust, the office I do hold of you, 
1.3.133	Not only take away, but let your sentence 
1.3.134	Even fall upon my life. 
1.3.135	Fetch Desdemona hither. 
1.3.136	Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place. [Exeunt Iago and Attendants. 
1.3.137	And, till she come, as truly as to heaven 
1.3.138	I do confess the vices of my blood, 
1.3.139	So justly to your grave ears I'll present 
1.3.140	How I did thrive in this fair lady's love, 
1.3.141	And she in mine. 
1.3.142	Say it, Othello. 
1.3.143	Her father loved me; oft invited me; 
1.3.144	Still question'd me the story of my life, 
1.3.145	From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, 
1.3.146	That I have pass'd. 
1.3.147	I ran it through, even from my boyish days, 
1.3.148	To the very moment that he bade me tell it; 
1.3.149	Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances, 
1.3.150	Of moving accidents by flood and field, 
1.3.151	Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach. 
1.3.152	Of being taken by the insolent foe 
1.3.153	And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence 
1.3.154	And portance in my travels' history: 
1.3.155	Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle, 
1.3.156	Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven, 
1.3.157	It was my hint to speak,--such was the process; 
1.3.158	And of the Cannibals that each other eat, 
1.3.159	The Anthropophagi and men whose heads 
1.3.160	Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear 
1.3.161	Would Desdemona seriously incline: 
1.3.162	But still the house-affairs would draw her thence: 
1.3.163	Which ever as she could with haste dispatch, 
1.3.164	She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear 
1.3.165	Devour up my discourse: which I observing, 
1.3.166	Took once a pliant hour, and found good means 
1.3.167	To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart 
1.3.168	That I would all my pilgrimage dilate, 
1.3.169	Whereof by parcels she had something heard, 
1.3.170	But not intentively: I aid consent, 
1.3.171	And often did beguile her of her tears, 
1.3.172	When I did speak of some distressful stroke 
1.3.173	That my youth suffer'd. My story being done, 
1.3.174	She gave me for my pains a world of sighs: 
1.3.175	She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange, 
1.3.176	'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful: 
1.3.177	She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd 
1.3.178	That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me, 
1.3.179	And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her, 
1.3.180	I should but teach him how to tell my story, 
1.3.181	And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake: 
1.3.182	She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd, 
1.3.183	And I loved her that she did pity them. 
1.3.184	This only is the witchcraft I have used: 
1.3.185	Here comes the lady; let her witness it. Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants. 
1.3.186	I think this tale would win my daughter too. 
1.3.187	Good Brabantio, 
1.3.188	Take up this mangled matter at the best: 
1.3.189	Men do their broken weapons rather use 
1.3.190	Than their bare hands. 
1.3.191	I pray you, hear her speak: 
1.3.192	If she confess that she was half the wooer, 
1.3.193	Destruction on my head, if my bad blame 
1.3.194	Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress: 
1.3.195	Do you perceive in all this noble company 
1.3.196	Where most you owe obedience? 
1.3.197	My noble father, 
1.3.198	I do perceive here a divided duty: 
1.3.199	To you I am bound for life and education; 
1.3.200	My life and education both do learn me 
1.3.201	How to respect you; you are the lord of duty; 
1.3.202	I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband, 
1.3.203	And so much duty as my mother show'd 
1.3.204	To you, preferring you before her father, 
1.3.205	So much I challenge that I may profess 
1.3.206	Due to the Moor my lord. 
1.3.207	God be wi' you! I have done. 
1.3.208	Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs: 
1.3.209	I had rather to adopt a child than get it. 
1.3.210	Come hither, Moor: 
1.3.211	I here do give thee that with all my heart 
1.3.212	Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart 
1.3.213	I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel, 
1.3.214	I am glad at soul I have no other child; 
1.3.215	For thy escape would teach me tyranny, 
1.3.216	To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord. 
1.3.217	Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence, 
1.3.218	Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers 
1.3.219	Into your favor. 
1.3.220	When remedies are past, the griefs are ended 
1.3.221	By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended. 
1.3.222	To mourn a mischief that is past and gone 
1.3.223	Is the next way to draw new mischief on. 
1.3.224	What cannot be preserved when fortune takes 
1.3.225	Patience her injury a mockery makes. 
1.3.226	The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief; 
1.3.227	He robs himself that spends a bootless grief. 
1.3.228	So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile; 
1.3.229	We lose it not, so long as we can smile. 
1.3.230	He bears the sentence well that nothing bears 
1.3.231	But the free comfort which from thence he hears, 
1.3.232	But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow 
1.3.233	That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow. 
1.3.234	These sentences, to sugar, or to gall, 
1.3.235	Being strong on both sides, are equivocal: 
1.3.236	But words are words; I never yet did hear 
1.3.237	That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear. 
1.3.238	I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state. 
1.3.239	The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition. 
1.3.240	The tyrant custom, most grave senators, 
1.3.241	Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war 
1.3.242	My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnize 
1.3.243	A natural and prompt alacrity 
1.3.244	I find in hardness, and do undertake 
1.3.245	These present wars against the Ottomites. 
1.3.246	Most humbly therefore bending to your state, 
1.3.247	I crave fit disposition for my wife, 
1.3.248	Due reference of place and exhibition, 
1.3.249	With such accommodation and besort 
1.3.250	As levels with her breeding.
1.3.251	If you please, 
1.3.252	Be't at her father's. 
1.3.253	I'll not have it so. 
1.3.254	Nor I. 
1.3.255	Nor I; I would not there reside, 
1.3.256	To put my father in impatient thoughts 
1.3.257	By being in his eye. Most gracious duke, 
1.3.258	To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear; 
1.3.259	And let me find a charter in your voice, 
1.3.260	To assist my simpleness. 
1.3.261	What would you, Desdemona? 
1.3.262	That I did love the Moor to live with him, 
1.3.263	My downright violence and storm of fortunes 
1.3.264	May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued 
1.3.265	Even to the very quality of my lord: 
1.3.266	I saw Othello's visage in his mind, 
1.3.267	And to his honors and his valiant parts 
1.3.268	Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate. 
1.3.269	So that, dear lords, if I be left behind, 
1.3.270	A moth of peace, and he go to the war, 
1.3.271	The rites for which I love him are bereft me, 
1.3.272	And I a heavy interim shall support 
1.3.273	By his dear absence. Let me go with him. 
1.3.274	Let her have your voices. 
1.3.275	Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not, 
1.3.276	To please the palate of my appetite, 
1.3.277	Nor to comply with heat--the young affects 
1.3.278	In me defunct--and proper satisfaction, 
1.3.279	But to be free and bounteous to her mind: 
1.3.280	And heaven defend your good souls, that you think 
1.3.281	I will your serious and great business scant 
1.3.282	For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys 
1.3.283	Of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dullness 
1.3.284	My speculative and officed instruments, 
1.3.285	That my disports corrupt and taint my business, 
1.3.286	Let housewives make a skillet of my helm, 
1.3.287	And all indign and base adversities 
1.3.288	Make head against my estimation! 
1.3.289	Be it as you shall privately determine, 
1.3.290	Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste, 
1.3.291	And speed must answer it. 
1.3.292	You must away to-night. 
1.3.293	With all my heart. 
1.3.294	At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again. 
1.3.295	Othello, leave some officer behind, 
1.3.296	And he shall our commission bring to you; 
1.3.297	With such things else of quality and respect 
1.3.298	As doth import you. 
1.3.299	So please your grace, my ancient; 
1.3.300	A man he is of honesty and trust: 
1.3.301	To his conveyance I assign my wife, 
1.3.302	With what else needful your good grace shall think 
1.3.303	To be sent after me. 
1.3.304	Let it be so. 
1.3.305	Good night to every one. [To Bra.] And, noble signior, 
1.3.306	If virtue no delighted beauty lack, 
1.3.307	Your son-in-law is far more fair than black. 
1.3.308	Adieu, brave Moor; use Desdemona well. 
1.3.309	Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see: 
1.3.310	She has deceived her father, and may thee. [Exeunt Duke, Senators, Officers, &c. 
1.3.311	My life upon her faith! Honest Iago, 
1.3.312	My Desdemona must I leave to thee: 
1.3.313	I prithee, let thy wife attend on her; 
1.3.314	And bring them after in the best advantage. 
1.3.315	Come Desdemona; I have but an hour 
1.3.316	Of love, of worldly matters and direction, 
1.3.317	To spend with thee: we must obey the time. [Exeunt Othello and Desdemona. 
1.3.318	Iago,-- 
1.3.319	What say'st thou, noble heart? 
1.3.320	What will I do, thinkest thou? 
1.3.321	Why, go to bed, and sleep. 
1.3.322	I will incontinently drown myself. 
1.3.323	If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly gentleman! 
1.3.324	It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician. 
1.3.325	O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven years; and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon. 
1.3.326	What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it. 
1.3.327	Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so that if we will plant nettles, or sow lettuce. set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions: but we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion. 
1.3.328	It cannot be. 
1.3.329	It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,--put money in thy purse,--nor he his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills:--fill thy purse with money:--the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must change for youth: when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice: she must have change, she must: therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her. 
1.3.330	Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue? 
1.3.331	Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him; if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more of this to-morrow. Adieu. 
1.3.332	Where shall we meet i' the morning? 
1.3.333	At my lodging. 
1.3.334	I'll be with thee betimes. 
1.3.335	Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo? 
1.3.336	What say you? 
1.3.337	No more of drowning, do you hear? 
1.3.338	I am changed: I'll go sell all my land. [Exit. 
1.3.339	Thus do I ever make my fool my purse; 
1.3.340	For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane, 
1.3.341	If I would time expend with such a snipe, 
1.3.342	But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor; 
1.3.343	And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets 
1.3.344	He hath done my office: I know not if't be true; 
1.3.345	But I, for mere suspicion in that kind, 
1.3.346	Will do as if for surety. He holds me well; 
1.3.347	The better shall my purpose work on him. 
1.3.348	Cassio's a proper man: let me see now: 
1.3.349	To get his place and to plume up my will 
1.3.350	In double knavery--How, how ?--Let's see:-- 
1.3.351	After some time, to abuse Othello's ear 
1.3.352	That he is too familiar with his wife. 
1.3.353	He hath a person and a smooth dispose 
1.3.354	To be suspected, framed to make women false. 
1.3.355	The Moor is of a free and open nature, 
1.3.356	That thinks men honest that but seem to be so, 
1.3.357	And will as tenderly be led by the nose 
1.3.358	As asses are. 
1.3.359	I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night 
1.3.360	Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light. [Exit. 
2.0.0	ACT II
2.1.1	A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay. 
2.1.2	Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen.
2.1.3	What from the cape can you discern at sea? 
2.1.4	Nothing at all: it is a high-wrought flood; 
2.1.5	I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main, 
2.1.6	Descry a sail. 
2.1.7	Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land; 
2.1.8	A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements: 
2.1.9	If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea, 
2.1.10	What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them, 
2.1.11	Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this? 
2.1.12	A segregation of the Turkish fleet: 
2.1.13	For do but stand upon the foaming shore, 
2.1.14	The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds; 
2.1.15	The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane, 
2.1.16	Seems to cast water on the burning bear, 
2.1.17	And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole: 
2.1.18	I never did like molestation view 
2.1.19	On the enchafed flood. 
2.1.20	If that the Turkish fleet 
2.1.21	Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd; 
2.1.22	It is impossible they bear it out. Enter a third Gentleman. 
2.1.23	News, lads! our wars are done. 
2.1.24	This desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks, 
2.1.25	That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice 
2.1.26	Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance 
2.1.27	On most part of their fleet. 
2.1.28	How! is this true? 
2.1.29	The ship is here put in, 
2.1.30	A Veronesa; Michael Cassio, 
2.1.31	Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello, 
2.1.32	Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea, 
2.1.33	And is in full commission here for Cyprus. 
2.1.34	I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
2.1.35	But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort 
2.1.36	Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly, 
2.1.37	And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted 
2.1.38	With foul and violent tempest. 
2.1.39	Pray heavens he be; 
2.1.40	For I have served him, and the man commands 
2.1.41	Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho! 
2.1.42	As well to see the vessel that's come in 
2.1.43	As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello, 
2.1.44	Even till we make the main and the aerial blue 
2.1.45	An indistinct regard. 
2.1.46	Come, let's do so; 
2.1.47	For every minute is expectancy 
2.1.48	Of more arrivance. Enter CASSIO. 
2.1.49	Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle, 
2.1.50	That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens 
2.1.51	Give him defence against the elements, 
2.1.52	For I have lost him on a dangerous sea. 
2.1.53	Is he well shipp'd? 
2.1.54	His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot 
2.1.55	Of very expert and approved allowance; 
2.1.56	Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death, 
2.1.57	Stand in bold cure. [A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'] Enter a fourth Gentleman. 
2.1.58	What noise? 
2.1.59	The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea 
2.1.60	Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!' 
2.1.61	My hopes do shape him for the governor. [Guns heard. 
2.1.62	They do discharge their shot of courtesy: 
2.1.63	Our friends at least. 
2.1.64	I pray you, sir, go forth, 
2.1.65	And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived. 
2.1.66	I shall. [Exit. 
2.1.67	But, good lieutenant, is your general wived? 
2.1.68	Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid 
2.1.69	That paragons description and wild fame; 
2.1.70	One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens, 
2.1.71	And in the essential vesture of creation 
2.1.72	Does tire the ingener. Re-enter second Gentleman. 
2.1.73	How now! who has put in? 
2.1.74	'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general. 
2.1.75	Has had most favorable and happy speed: 
2.1.76	Tempests themselves, high seas and howling winds, 
2.1.77	The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands,-- 
2.1.78	Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,-- 
2.1.79	As having sense of beauty, do omit 
2.1.80	Their mortal natures, letting so safely by 
2.1.81	The divine Desdemona. 
2.1.82	What is she? 
2.1.83	She that I spake of, our great captain's captain, 
2.1.84	Left in the conduct of the bold lago, 
2.1.85	Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts 
2.1.86	A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard, 
2.1.87	And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath, 
2.1.88	That he may bless this bay with his tall ship, 
2.1.89	Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms, 
2.1.90	Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits, 
2.1.91	And bring all Cyprus comfort! Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants. 
2.1.92	O, behold, 
2.1.93	The riches of the ship is come on shore! 
2.1.94	Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees. 
2.1.95	Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven, 
2.1.96	Before, behind thee and on every hand, 
2.1.97	Enwheel thee round! 
2.1.98	I thank you, valiant Cassio. 
2.1.99	What tidings can you tell me of my lord? 
2.1.100	He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught 
2.1.101	But that he's well and will be shortly here. 
2.1.102	O, but I fear--How lost you company? 
2.1.103	The great contention of the sea and skies 
2.1.104	Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail. [Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard. 
2.1.105	They give their greeting to the citadel: 
2.1.106	This likewise is a friend. 
2.1.107	See for the news. [Exit Gentleman. 
2.1.108	Good ancient, you are welcome. [To Emilia] 
2.1.109	Welcome, mistress: 
2.1.110	Let it not gall your patience, good Iago, 
2.1.111	That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding 
2.1.112	That gives me this bold show of courtesy. [Kissing her. 
2.1.113	Sir, would she give you so much of her lips 
2.1.114	As of her tongue she oft bestows on me, 
2.1.115	You'ld have enough. 
2.1.116	Alas, she has no speech. 
2.1.117	In faith, too much; 
2.1.118	I find it still, when I have list to sleep: 
2.1.119	Marry, before your ladyship, I grant, 
2.1.120	She puts her tongue a little in her heart, 
2.1.121	And chides with thinking. 
2.1.122	You have little cause to say so. 
2.1.123	Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors, 
2.1.124	Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens, 
2.1.125	Saints in your injuries, devils being offended, 
2.1.126	Players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds. 
2.1.127	O, fie upon thee, slanderer! 
2.1.128	Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk: 
2.1.129	You rise to play and go to bed to work. 
2.1.130	You shall not write my praise. 
2.1.131	No, let me not. 
2.1.132	What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me? 
2.1.133	O gentle lady, do not put me to 't; 
2.1.134	For I am nothing, if not critical. 
2.1.135	Come on, assay. There's one gone to the harbor? 
2.1.136	Ay, madam. 
2.1.137	I am not merry; but I do beguile 
2.1.138	The thing I am, by seeming otherwise. 
2.1.139	Come, how wouldst thou praise me? 
2.1.140	I am about it; but indeed my invention 
2.1.141	Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize; 
2.1.142	It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labors, 
2.1.143	And thus she is deliver'd. 
2.1.144	If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit, 
2.1.145	The one's for use, the other useth it. 
2.1.146	Well praised! How if she be black and witty? 
2.1.147	If she be black, and thereto have a wit, 
2.1.148	She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit. 
2.1.149	Worse and worse. 
2.1.150	How if fair and foolish? 
2.1.151	She never yet was foolish that was fair; 
2.1.152	For even her folly help'd her to an heir. 
2.1.153	These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolish? 
2.1.154	There's none so foul and foolish thereunto, 
2.1.155	But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do. 
2.1.156	O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself? 
2.1.157	She that was ever fair and never proud, 
2.1.158	Had tongue at will and yet was never loud, 
2.1.159	Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay, 
2.1.160	Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,' 
2.1.161	She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh, 
2.1.162	Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly, 
2.1.163	She that in wisdom never was so frail 
2.1.164	To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail, 
2.1.165	She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind, 
2.1.166	See suitors following and not look behind, 
2.1.167	She was a wight, if ever such wight were,-- 
2.1.168	To do what? 
2.1.169	To suckle fools and chronicle small beer. 
2.1.170	O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor? 
2.1.171	He speaks home, madam: you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar. 
2.1.172	 Aside He takes her by the palm: ay, well said, whisper: with as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake! [Trumpet within.] 
2.1.173	The Moor! 
2.1.174	I know his trumpet. 
2.1.175	'Tis truly so. 
2.1.176	Let's meet him and receive him. 
2.1.177	Lo, where he comes! Enter OTHELLO and Attendants. 
2.1.178	O my fair warrior! 
2.1.179	My dear Othello! 
2.1.180	It gives me wonder great as my content 
2.1.181	To see you here before me. O my soul's joy! 
2.1.182	If after every tempest come such calms, 
2.1.183	May the winds blow till they have waken'd death! 
2.1.184	And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas 
2.1.185	Olympus-high and duck again as low 
2.1.186	As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die, 
2.1.187	'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear, 
2.1.188	My soul hath her content so absolute 
2.1.189	That not another comfort like to this 
2.1.190	Succeeds in unknown fate. 
2.1.191	The heavens forbid 
2.1.192	But that our loves and comforts should increase, 
2.1.193	Even as our days do grow! 
2.1.194	Amen to that, sweet powers! 
2.1.195	I cannot speak enough of this content; 
2.1.196	It stops me here; it is too much of joy: 
2.1.197	And this, and this, the greatest discords be [Kissing her. 
2.1.198	That e'er our hearts shall make! 
2.1.199	 [Aside] O, you are well tuned now! 
2.1.200	But I'll set down the pegs that make this music, 
2.1.201	As honest as I am. 
2.1.202	Come, let us to the castle. 
2.1.203	News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks are drown'd. 
2.1.204	How does my old acquaintance of this isle? 
2.1.205	Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus; 
2.1.206	I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet, 
2.1.207	I prattle out of fashion, and I dote 
2.1.208	In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago, 
2.1.209	Go to the bay and disembark my coffers: 
2.1.210	Bring thou the master to the citadel; 
2.1.211	He is a good one, and his worthiness 
2.1.212	Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona, 
2.1.213	Once more, well met at Cyprus. [Exeunt Othello, Desdemona, and Attendants. 
2.1.214	Do thou meet me presently at the harbor. Come hither. If thou be'st valiant, --as, they say, base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them,--list me. The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is directly in love with him. 
2.1.215	With him! why, 'tis not possible. 
2.1.216	Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies: and will she love him still for prating? let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most pregnant and unforced position--who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why, none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman hath found him already. 
2.1.217	I cannot believe that in her; she's full of most blessed condition. 
2.1.218	Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst not mark that? 
2.1.219	Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy. 
2.1.220	Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night; for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister. 
2.1.221	Well. 
2.1.222	Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the impediment most profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity. 
2.1.223	I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity. 
2.1.224	I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel: I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell. 
2.1.225	Adieu. [Exit. 
2.1.226	That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it; 
2.1.227	That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit: 
2.1.228	The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not, 
2.1.229	Is of a constant, loving, noble nature, 
2.1.230	And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona 
2.1.231	A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too; 
2.1.232	Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure 
2.1.233	I stand accountant for as great a sin, 
2.1.234	But partly led to diet my revenge, 
2.1.235	For that I do suspect the lusty Moor 
2.1.236	Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof 
2.1.237	Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards; 
2.1.238	And nothing can or shall content my soul 
2.1.239	Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife, 
2.1.240	Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor 
2.1.241	At least into a jealousy so strong 
2.1.242	That judgement cannot cure. Which thing to do, 
2.1.243	If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash 
2.1.244	For his quick hunting, stand the putting on, 
2.1.245	I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip, 
2.1.246	Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb-- 
2.1.247	For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too-- 
2.1.248	Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me, 
2.1.249	For making him egregiously an ass 
2.1.250	And practising upon his peace and quiet 
2.1.251	Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused: 
2.1.252	Knavery's plain face is never seen till used. [Exit.
2.2.1	A street. 
2.2.2	Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People following.
2.2.3	It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived, importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet, every man put himself into triumph; some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed All offices are open, and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello! [Exeunt.
2.3.1	A hall in the castle. 
2.3.2	Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and Attendants.
2.3.3	Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night: 
2.3.4	Let's teach ourselves that honorable stop, 
2.3.5	Not to outsport discretion. 
2.3.6	Iago hath direction what to do; 
2.3.7	But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye 
2.3.8	Will I look to't. 
2.3.9	Iago is most honest. 
2.3.10	Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest 
2.3.11	Let me have speech with you.
2.3.12	[To Desdemona] Come, my dear love, 
2.3.13	The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue; 
2.3.14	That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you. 
2.3.15	Good night. [Exeunt Othello, Desdemona, and Attendants. Enter IAGO. 
2.3.16	Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch. 
2.3.17	Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our general casts us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame: he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and she is sport for Jove. 
2.3.18	She's a most exquisite lady. 
2.3.19	And, I'll warrant her, full of game. 
2.3.20	Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature. 
2.3.21	What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of provocation. 
2.3.22	An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest. 
2.3.23	And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love? 
2.3.24	She is indeed perfection. 
2.3.25	Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello. 
2.3.26	Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment. 
2.3.27	O, they are our friends; but one cup: 
2.3.28	I'll drink for you. 
2.3.29	I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more. 
2.3.30	What, man! 'tis a night of revels; the gallants desire it. 
2.3.31	Where are they? 
2.3.32	Here at the door; I pray you, call them in. 
2.3.33	I'll do 't; but it dislikes me. [Exit. 
2.3.34	If I can fasten but one cup upon him, 
2.3.35	With that which he hath drunk to-night already, 
2.3.36	He'll be as full of quarrel and offence 
2.3.37	As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo, 
2.3.38	Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out, 
2.3.39	To Desdemona hath to-night caroused 
2.3.40	Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch: 
2.3.41	Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits, 
2.3.42	That hold their honors in a wary distance, 
2.3.43	The very elements of this warlike isle, 
2.3.44	Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups, 
2.3.45	And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards, 
2.3.46	Am I to put our Cassio in some action 
2.3.47	That may offend the isle.--But here they come: 
2.3.48	If consequence do but approve my dream, 
2.3.49	My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream. Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; Servants following with wine. 
2.3.50	'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already. 
2.3.51	Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a soldier. 
2.3.52	Some wine, ho! 
2.3.53	 [Sings] And let me the canakin clink, clink; 
2.3.54	And let me the canakin clink: 
2.3.55	A soldier's but a man;
2.3.56	A life's but a span; 
2.3.57	Why, then, let a soldier drink. 
2.3.58	Some wine, boys! 
2.3.59	'Fore God, an excellent song. 
2.3.60	I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothing to your English. 
2.3.61	Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking? 
2.3.62	Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle can be filled. 
2.3.63	To the health of our general! 
2.3.64	I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice. 
2.3.65	O sweet England! 
2.3.66	King Stephen was a worthy peer, His breeches cost him but a crown; 
2.3.67	He held them sixpence all too dear, With that he call'd the tailor lown. 
2.3.68	He was a wight of high renown, And thou art but of low degree: 
2.3.69	'Tis pride that pulls the country down; Then take thine auld cloak about thee. 
2.3.70	Some wine, ho! 
2.3.71	Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other. 
2.3.72	Will you hear't again? 
2.3.73	No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things. Well, God's above all; and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved. 
2.3.74	It's true, good lieutenant. 
2.3.75	For mine own part,--no offence to the general, nor any man of quality,--I hope to be saved. 
2.3.76	And so do I too, lieutenant. 
2.3.77	Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive us our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk: this is my ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left: I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and speak well enough. 
2.3.78	Excellent well. 
2.3.79	Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk. [Exit. 
2.3.80	To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch. 
2.3.81	You see this fellow that is gone before; 
2.3.82	He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar 
2.3.83	And give direction: and do but see his vice; 
2.3.84	'Tis to his virtue a just equinox, 
2.3.85	The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him. 
2.3.86	I fear the trust Othello puts him in, 
2.3.87	On some odd time of his infirmity, 
2.3.88	Will shake this island. 
2.3.89	But is he often thus? 
2.3.90	'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep: 
2.3.91	He'll watch the horologe a double set, 
2.3.92	If drink rock not his cradle. 
2.3.93	It were well 
2.3.94	The general were put in mind of it. 
2.3.95	Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature 
2.3.96	Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio, 
2.3.97	And looks not on his evils: is not this true? Enter RODERIGO. 
2.3.98	 [Aside to him] How now, Roderigo! 
2.3.99	I pray you, after the lieutenant; go. [Exit Roderigo, 
2.3.100	And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor 
2.3.101	Should hazard such a place as his own second 
2.3.102	With one of an ingraft infirmity: 
2.3.103	It were an honest action to say 
2.3.104	So to the Moor. 
2.3.105	Not I, for this fair island: 
2.3.106	I do love Cassio well; and would do much 
2.3.107	To cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise? [Cry within: 'Help! help!' Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO. 
2.3.108	You rogue! you rascal! 
2.3.109	What's the matter, lieutenant? 
2.3.110	A knave teach me my duty! 
2.3.111	I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle. 
2.3.112	Beat me! 
2.3.113	Dost thou prate, rogue? [Striking Roderigo. 
2.3.114	Nay, good lieutenant; [Staying him. 
2.3.115	I pray you, sir, hold your hand. 
2.3.116	Let me go, sir, 
2.3.117	Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard. 
2.3.118	Come, come, you're drunk. 
2.3.119	Drunk! [They fight. 
2.3.120	 Aside to Roderigo Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny. [Exit Roderigo. 
2.3.121	Nay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;-- 
2.3.122	Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,-sir;-- 
2.3.123	Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed! [Bell rings. 
2.3.124	Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho! 
2.3.125	The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold! 
2.3.126	You will be shamed for ever. Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants. 
2.3.127	What is the matter here? 
2.3.128	'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death. [Faints. 
2.3.129	Hold, for your lives! 
2.3.130	Hold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--gentlemen,-- 
2.3.131	Have you forgot all sense of place and duty? 
2.3.132	Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame! 
2.3.133	Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this? 
2.3.134	Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that 
2.3.135	Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites? 
2.3.136	For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl: 
2.3.137	He that stirs next to carve for his own rage 
2.3.138	Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion. 
2.3.139	Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle 
2.3.140	>From her propriety. What is the matter, masters? 
2.3.141	Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving, 
2.3.142	Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee. 
2.3.143	I do not know: friends all but now, even now, 
2.3.144	In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom 
2.3.145	Devesting them for bed; and then, but now-- 
2.3.146	As if some planet had unwitted men-- 
2.3.147	Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast, 
2.3.148	In opposition bloody. I cannot speak 
2.3.149	Any beginning to this peevish odds; 
2.3.150	And would in action glorious I had lost 
2.3.151	Those legs that brought me to a part of it! 
2.3.152	How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot? 
2.3.153	I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak. 
2.3.154	Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil; 
2.3.155	The gravity and stillness of your youth 
2.3.156	The world hath noted, and your name is great 
2.3.157	In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter, 
2.3.158	That you unlace your reputation thus 
2.3.159	And spend your rich opinion for the name 
2.3.160	Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it. 
2.3.161	Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger: 
2.3.162	Your officer, Iago, can inform you,-- 
2.3.163	While I spare speech, which something now offends me,-- 
2.3.164	Of all that I do know: nor know I aught 
2.3.165	By me that's said or done amiss this night; 
2.3.166	Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice, 
2.3.167	And to defend ourselves it be a sin 
2.3.168	When violence assails us. 
2.3.169	Now, by heaven, 
2.3.170	My blood begins my safer guides to rule; 
2.3.171	And passion, having my best judgement collied, 
2.3.172	Assays to lead the way: if I once stir, 
2.3.173	Or do but lift this arm. the best of you 
2.3.174	Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know 
2.3.175	How this foul rant began, who set it on; 
2.3.176	And he that is approved in this offence, 
2.3.177	Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth, 
2.3.178	Shall lose me. What! in a town of war, 
2.3.179	Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear, 
2.3.180	To manage private and domestic quarrel, 
2.3.181	In night, and on the court and guard of safety! 
2.3.182	'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began 't? 
2.3.183	If partially affined, or leagued in office, 
2.3.184	Thou dost deliver more or less than truth, 
2.3.185	Thou art no soldier. 
2.3.186	Touch me not so near: 
2.3.187	I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth 
2.3.188	Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio; 
2.3.189	Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth 
2.3.190	Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general. 
2.3.191	Montano and myself being in speech, 
2.3.192	There comes a fellow crying out for help; 
2.3.193	And Cassio following him with determined sword, 
2.3.194	To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman 
2.3.195	Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause: 
2.3.196	Myself the crying fellow did pursue, 
2.3.197	Lest by his clamor--as it so fell out-- 
2.3.198	The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot, 
2.3.199	Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather 
2.3.200	For that I heard the clink and fall of swords, 
2.3.201	And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night 
2.3.202	I ne'er might say before. When I came back-- 
2.3.203	For this was brief--I found them close together, 
2.3.204	At blow and thrust; even as again they were 
2.3.205	When you yourself did part them. 
2.3.206	More of this matter cannot I report: 
2.3.207	But men are men; the best sometimes forget: 
2.3.208	Though Cassio did some little wrong to him, 
2.3.209	As men in rage strike those that wish them best, 
2.3.210	Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received 
2.3.211	>From him that fled some strange indignity, 
2.3.212	Which patience, could not pass. 
2.3.213	I know, Iago, 
2.3.214	Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter, 
2.3.215	Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee; 
2.3.216	But never more be officer of mine. Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended. 
2.3.217	Look, if my gentle love be not raised up! 
2.3.218	I'll make thee an example. 
2.3.219	What's the matter? 
2.3.220	All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed. 
2.3.221	Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon: 
2.3.222	Lead him off. [To Montano, who is led off. 
2.3.223	Iago, look with care about the town, 
2.3.224	And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted. 
2.3.225	Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life 
2.3.226	To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife. [Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio. 
2.3.227	What, are you hurt, lieutenant? 
2.3.228	Ay, past all surgery. 
2.3.229	Marry, heaven forbid! 
2.3.230	Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation! 
2.3.231	As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deserving: you have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man! there are ways to recover the general again: you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice; even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue to him again, and he's yours. 
2.3.232	I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil! 
2.3.233	What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you? 
2.3.234	I know not. 
2.3.235	Is't possible? 
2.3.236	I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance, revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts! 
2.3.237	Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus recovered? 
2.3.238	It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath: one unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself. 
2.3.239	Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen; but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good. 
2.3.240	I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil. 
2.3.241	Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used: exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you. 
2.3.242	I have well approved it, sir. I drunk! 
2.3.243	You or any man living may be drunk at a time, man. I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife is now the general: I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune her help to put you in your place again: she is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested: this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before. 
2.3.244	You advise me well. 
2.3.245	I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness. 
2.3.246	I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me: I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here. 
2.3.247	You are in the right. Good night. lieutenant; I must to the watch. 
2.3.248	Good night, honest Iago. [Exit. 
2.3.249	And what's he then that says I play the villain? 
2.3.250	When this advice is free I give and honest, 
2.3.251	Probal to thinking and indeed the course 
2.3.252	To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy 
2.3.253	The inclining Desdemona to subdue 
2.3.254	In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful 
2.3.255	As the free elements. And then for her 
2.3.256	To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism, 
2.3.257	All seals and symbols of redeemed sin, 
2.3.258	His soul is so enfetter'd to her love, 
2.3.259	That she may make, unmake, do what she list, 
2.3.260	Even as her appetite shall play the god 
2.3.261	With his weak function. How am I then a villain 
2.3.262	To counsel Cassio to this parallel course, 
2.3.263	Directly to his good? Divinity of hell! 
2.3.264	When devils will the blackest sins put on, 
2.3.265	They do suggest at first with heavenly shows, 
2.3.266	As I do now: for whiles this honest fool 
2.3.267	Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes 
2.3.268	And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor, 
2.3.269	I'll pour this pestilence into his ear, 
2.3.270	That she repeals him for her body's lust; 
2.3.271	And by how much she strives to do him good, 
2.3.272	She shall undo her credit with the Moor, 
2.3.273	So will I turn her virtue into pitch, 
2.3.274	And out of her own goodness make the net 
2.3.275	That shall enmesh them all. Re-enter RODERIGO. 
2.3.276	How now, Roderigo! 
2.3.277	I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall have so much experience for my pains, and so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice. 
2.3.278	How poor are they that have not patience! 
2.3.279	What wound did ever heal but by degrees? 
2.3.280	Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft; 
2.3.281	And wit depends on dilatory time. 
2.3.282	Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee, 
2.3.283	And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio: 
2.3.284	Though other things grow fair against the sun, 
2.3.285	Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe: 
2.3.286	Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning; 
2.3.287	Pleasure and action make the hours seem short. 
2.3.288	Retire thee; go where thou art billeted: 
2.3.289	Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter: 
2.3.290	Nay, get thee gone. [Exit Roderigo.] Two things are to be done: 
2.3.291	My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress; 
2.3.292	I'll set her on; 
2.3.293	Myself the while to draw the Moor apart, 
2.3.294	And bring him jump when he may Cassio find 
2.3.295	Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way: 
2.3.296	Dull not device by coldness and delay. [Exit.
3.0.0	ACT III
3.1.1	Before the Castle. 
3.1.2	Enter CASSIO and some Musicians. 
3.1.3	Masters, play here; I will content your pains; 
3.1.4	Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.' Music. Enter Clown. 
3.1.5	Why, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i' the nose thus? 
3.1.6	How, sir, how! 
3.1.7	Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments? 
3.1.8	Ay, marry, are they, sir. 
3.1.9	O, thereby hangs a tail. 
3.1.10	Whereby hangs a tale, sir? 
3.1.11	Marry, sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know. But, masters, here's money for you: and the general so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more noise with it. 
3.1.12	Well, sir, we will not. 
3.1.13	If you have any music that may not be heard, to 't again: but, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly care. 
3.1.14	We have none such, sir. 
3.1.15	Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away: go; vanish into air; away! Exeunt Musicians. 
3.1.16	Dost thou hear, my honest friend? 
3.1.17	No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you. 
3.1.18	Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech: wilt thou do this? 
3.1.19	She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her. 
3.1.20	Do, good my friend. Exit Clown. Enter IAGO. 
3.1.21	In happy time, Iago, 
3.1.22	You have not been a-bed, then? 
3.1.23	Why, no; the day had broke 
3.1.24	Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago, 
3.1.25	To send in to your wife: my suit to her 
3.1.26	Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona 
3.1.27	Procure me some access. 
3.1.28	I'll send her to you presently; 
3.1.29	And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor 
3.1.30	Out of the way, that your converse and business 
3.1.31	May be more free. 
3.1.32	I humbly thank you for't. Exit Iago. 
3.1.33	I never knew 
3.1.34	A Florentine more kind and honest. Enter EMILIA. 
3.1.35	Good morrow, good lieutenant: I am sorry 
3.1.36	For your displeasure; but all will sure be well. 
3.1.37	The general and his wife are talking of it; 
3.1.38	And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies, 
3.1.39	That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus 
3.1.40	And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom 
3.1.41	He might not but refuse you, but he protests he loves you 
3.1.42	And needs no other suitor but his likings 
3.1.43	To take the safest occasion by the front 
3.1.44	To bring you in again. 
3.1.45	Yet, I beseech you, 
3.1.46	If you think fit, or that it may be done, 
3.1.47	Give me advantage of some brief discourse 
3.1.48	With Desdemona alone. 
3.1.49	Pray you, come in: 
3.1.50	I will bestow you where you shall have time 
3.1.51	To speak your bosom freely. 
3.1.52	I am much bound to you. Exeunt.
3.2.1	A room in the castle. 
3.2.2	Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Gentlemen.
3.2.3	These letters give, Iago, to the pilot; 
3.2.4	And by him do my duties to the senate: 
3.2.5	That done, I will be walking on the works; 
3.2.6	Repair there to me. 
3.2.7	Well, my good lord, I'll do't. 
3.2.8	This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see 't? 
3.2.9	We'll wait upon your lordship. Exeunt.
3.3.1	The garden of the castle. 
3.3.2	Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA.
3.3.3	Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do 
3.3.4	All my abilities in thy behalf. 
3.3.5	Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband, 
3.3.6	As if the case were his. 
3.3.7	O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio, 
3.3.8	But I will have my lord and you again 
3.3.9	As friendly as you were. 
3.3.10	Bounteous madam, 
3.3.11	Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio, 
3.3.12	He's never any thing but your true servant. 
3.3.13	I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord: 
3.3.14	You have known him long; and be you well assured 
3.3.15	He shall in strangeness stand no further off 
3.3.16	Than in a politic distance. 
3.3.17	Ay, but, lady, 
3.3.18	That policy may either last so long, 
3.3.19	Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet, 
3.3.20	Or breed itself so out of circumstance, 
3.3.21	That, I being absent and my place supplied, 
3.3.22	My general will forget my love and service. 
3.3.23	Do not doubt that; before Emilia here 
3.3.24	I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee, 
3.3.25	If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it 
3.3.26	To the last article: my lord shall never rest; 
3.3.27	I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience; 
3.3.28	His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift; 
3.3.29	I'll intermingle every thing he does 
3.3.30	With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio; 
3.3.31	For thy solicitor shall rather die 
3.3.32	Than give thy cause away. 
3.3.33	Madam, here comes my lord. 
3.3.34	Madam, I'll take my leave. 
3.3.35	Why, stay, and hear me speak. 
3.3.36	Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease, 
3.3.37	Unfit for mine own purposes. 
3.3.38	Well, do your discretion. Exit Cassio. Enter OTHELLO and IAGO. 
3.3.39	Ha! I like not that. 
3.3.40	What dost thou say? 
3.3.41	Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what. 
3.3.42	Was not that Cassio parted from my wife? 
3.3.43	Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it, 
3.3.44	That he would steal away so guilty-like, 
3.3.45	Seeing you coming. 
3.3.46	I do believe 'twas he. 
3.3.47	How now, my lord! 
3.3.48	I have been talking with a suitor here, 
3.3.49	A man that languishes in your displeasure. 
3.3.50	Who is't you mean? 
3.3.51	Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord, 
3.3.52	If I have any grace or power to move you, 
3.3.53	His present reconciliation take; 
3.3.54	For if he be not one that truly loves you, 
3.3.55	That errs in ignorance and not in cunning, 
3.3.56	I have no judgement in an honest face: 
3.3.57	I prithee, call him back. 
3.3.58	Went he hence now? 
3.3.59	Ay, sooth; so humbled 
3.3.60	That he hath left part of his grief with me, 
3.3.61	To suffer with him. Good love, call him back. 
3.3.62	Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time. 
3.3.63	But shall 't be shortly? 
3.3.64	The sooner, sweet, for you. 
3.3.65	Shall't be to-night at supper? 
3.3.66	No, not to-night. 
3.3.67	To-morrow dinner, then? 
3.3.68	I shall not dine at home; 
3.3.69	I meet the captains at the citadel. 
3.3.70	Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn; 
3.3.71	On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn: 
3.3.72	I prithee, name the time, but let it not 
3.3.73	Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent; 
3.3.74	And yet his trespass, in our common reason-- 
3.3.75	Save that, they say, the wars must make examples 
3.3.76	Out of their best--is not almost a fault 
3.3.77	To incur a private check. When shall he come? 
3.3.78	Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul, 
3.3.79	What you would ask me, that I should deny, 
3.3.80	Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio, 
3.3.81	That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time, 
3.3.82	When I have spoke of you dispraisingly, 
3.3.83	Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do 
3.3.84	To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,-- 
3.3.85	Prithee, no more: let him come when he will; 
3.3.86	I will deny thee nothing. 
3.3.87	Why, this is not a boon; 
3.3.88	'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves, 
3.3.89	Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, 
3.3.90	Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit 
3.3.91	To your own person: nay, when I have a suit 
3.3.92	Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed, 
3.3.93	It shall be full of poise and difficult weight 
3.3.94	And fearful to be granted. 
3.3.95	I will deny thee nothing: 
3.3.96	Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this, 
3.3.97	To leave me but a little to myself. 
3.3.98	Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord. 
3.3.99	Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight. 
3.3.100	Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you; 
3.3.101	Whate'er you be, I am obedient. Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia. 
3.3.102	Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul, 
3.3.103	But I do love thee! and when I love thee not, 
3.3.104	Chaos is come again. 
3.3.105	My noble lord,-- 
3.3.106	What dost thou say, Iago? 
3.3.107	Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady, 
3.3.108	Know of your love? 
3.3.109	He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask? 
3.3.110	But for a satisfaction of my thought; 
3.3.111	No further harm. 
3.3.112	Why of thy thought, Iago? 
3.3.113	I did not think he had been acquainted with her. 
3.3.114	O, yes; and went between us very oft. 
3.3.115	Indeed! 
3.3.116	Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that? 
3.3.117	Is he not honest? 
3.3.118	Honest, my lord! 
3.3.119	Honest! ay, honest. 
3.3.120	My lord, for aught I know. 
3.3.121	What dost thou think? 
3.3.122	Think, my lord! 
3.3.123	Think my lord! 
3.3.124	By heaven, he echoes me, 
3.3.125	As if there were some monster in his thought 
3.3.126	Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something: 
3.3.127	I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that, 
3.3.128	When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like? 
3.3.129	And when I told thee he was of my counsel 
3.3.130	In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!' 
3.3.131	And didst contract and purse thy brow together, 
3.3.132	As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain 
3.3.133	Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me, 
3.3.134	Show me thy thought. 
3.3.135	My lord, you know I love you. 
3.3.136	I think thou dost; 
3.3.137	And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty, 
3.3.138	And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath, 
3.3.139	Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more: 
3.3.140	For such things in a false disloyal knave 
3.3.141	Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just 
3.3.142	They are close delations, working from the heart 
3.3.143	That passion cannot rule. 
3.3.144	For Michael Cassio 
3.3.145	I dare be sworn I think that he is honest. 
3.3.146	I think so too. 
3.3.147	Men should be what they seem; 
3.3.148	Or those that be not, would they might seem none! 
3.3.149	Certain, men should be what they seem. 
3.3.150	Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man. 
3.3.151	Nay, yet there's more in this: 
3.3.152	I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings, 
3.3.153	As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts 
3.3.154	The worst of words. 
3.3.155	Good my lord, pardon me: 
3.3.156	Though I am bound to every act of duty, 
3.3.157	I am not bound to that all slaves are free to. 
3.3.158	Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false; 
3.3.159	As where's that palace whereinto foul things 
3.3.160	Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure, 
3.3.161	But some uncleanly apprehensions 
3.3.162	Keep leets and law-days and in session sit 
3.3.163	With meditations lawful? 
3.3.164	Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, 
3.3.165	If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear 
3.3.166	A stranger to thy thoughts. 
3.3.167	I do beseech you-- 
3.3.168	Though I perchance am vicious in my guess, 
3.3.169	As, I confess, it is my nature's plague 
3.3.170	To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy 
3.3.171	Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet, 
3.3.172	From one that so imperfectly conceits, 
3.3.173	Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble 
3.3.174	Out of his scattering and unsure observance. 
3.3.175	It were not for your quiet nor your good, 
3.3.176	Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom 
3.3.177	To let you know my thoughts. 
3.3.178	What dost thou mean? 
3.3.179	Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, 
3.3.180	Is the immediate jewel of their souls: 
3.3.181	Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing; 
3.3.182	'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands; 
3.3.183	But he that filches from me my good name 
3.3.184	Robs me of that which not enriches him 
3.3.185	And makes me poor indeed. 
3.3.186	By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts. 
3.3.187	You cannot, if my heart were in your hand; 
3.3.188	Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody. 
3.3.189	Ha! 
3.3.190	O, beware, my lord, of jealousy; 
3.3.191	It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock 
3.3.192	The meat it feeds on: that cuckold lives in bliss 
3.3.193	Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger; 
3.3.194	But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er 
3.3.195	Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves! 
3.3.196	O misery! 
3.3.197	Poor and content is rich and rich enough, 
3.3.198	But riches fineless is as poor as winter 
3.3.199	To him that ever fears he shall be poor. 
3.3.200	Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend 
3.3.201	From jealousy! 
3.3.202	Why, why is this? 
3.3.203	Think'st thou I'ld make a life of jealousy, 
3.3.204	To follow still the changes of the moon 
3.3.205	With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt 
3.3.206	Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat, 
3.3.207	When I shall turn the business of my soul 
3.3.208	To such exsufflicate and blown surmises, 
3.3.209	Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous 
3.3.210	To say my wife is fair,--feeds well, loves company, 
3.3.211	Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well; 
3.3.212	Where virtue is, these are more virtuous: 
3.3.213	Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw 
3.3.214	The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt; 
3.3.215	For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago; 
3.3.216	I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove; 
3.3.217	And on the proof, there is no more but this,-- 
3.3.218	Away at once with love or jealousy! 
3.3.219	I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason 
3.3.220	To show the love and duty that I bear you 
3.3.221	With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound, 
3.3.222	Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof. 
3.3.223	Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio; 
3.3.224	Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure: 
3.3.225	I would not have your free and noble nature, 
3.3.226	Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't: 
3.3.227	I know our country disposition well; 
3.3.228	In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks 
3.3.229	They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience 
3.3.230	Is not to leave 't undone, but keep't unknown. 
3.3.231	Dost thou say so? 
3.3.232	She did deceive her father, marrying you; 
3.3.233	And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks, 
3.3.234	She loved them most. 
3.3.235	And so she did. 
3.3.236	Why, go to then; 
3.3.237	She that, so young, could give out such a seeming, 
3.3.238	To seel her father's eyes up close as oak-- 
3.3.239	He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame; 
3.3.240	I humbly do beseech you of your pardon 
3.3.241	For too much loving you. 
3.3.242	I am bound to thee for ever. 
3.3.243	I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits. 
3.3.244	Not a jot, not a jot. 
3.3.245	I' faith, I fear it has. 
3.3.246	I hope you will consider what is spoke 
3.3.247	Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved: 
3.3.248	I am to pray you not to strain my speech 
3.3.249	To grosser issues nor to larger reach 
3.3.250	Than to suspicion. 
3.3.251	I will not. 
3.3.252	Should you do so, my lord, 
3.3.253	My speech should fall into such vile success 
3.3.254	As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend-- 
3.3.255	My lord, I see you're moved. 
3.3.256	No, not much moved: 
3.3.257	I do not think but Desdemona's honest. 
3.3.258	Long live she so! and long live you to think so! 
3.3.259	And yet, how nature erring, from itself,-- 
3.3.260	Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you-- 
3.3.261	Not to affect many proposed matches 
3.3.262	Of her own clime, complexion, and degree, 
3.3.263	Whereto we see in all things nature tends- 
3.3.264	Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank, 
3.3.265	Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural. 
3.3.266	But pardon me; I do not in position 
3.3.267	Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear 
3.3.268	Her will, recoil ng to her better judgement, 
3.3.269	May fall to match you with her country forms 
3.3.270	And happily repent. 
3.3.271	Farewell, farewell: 
3.3.272	If more thou dost perceive, let me know more; 
3.3.273	Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago.
3.3.274	Going
3.3.275	My lord, I take my leave. 
3.3.276	Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless 
3.3.277	Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
3.3.278	Returning
3.3.279	My lord, I would I might entreat your honour 
3.3.280	To scan this thing no further; leave it to time: 
3.3.281	Though it be fit that Cassio have his place, 
3.3.282	For, sure, he fills it up with great ability, 
3.3.283	Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile, 
3.3.284	You shall by that perceive him and his means: 
3.3.285	Note, if your lady strain his entertainment 
3.3.286	With any strong or vehement importunity; 
3.3.287	Much will be seen in that. In the mean time, 
3.3.288	Let me be thought too busy in my fears-- 
3.3.289	As worthy cause I have to fear I am-- 
3.3.290	And hold her free, I do beseech your honour. 
3.3.291	Fear not my government. 
3.3.292	I once more take my leave. Exit. 
3.3.293	This fellow's of exceeding honesty, 
3.3.294	And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit, 
3.3.295	Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard, 
3.3.296	Though that her jesses--were my dear heartstrings, 
3.3.297	I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind, 
3.3.298	To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black 
3.3.299	And have not those soft parts of conversation 
3.3.300	That chamberers have, or for I am declined 
3.3.301	Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much-- 
3.3.302	She's gone. I am abused; and my relief 
3.3.303	Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage, 
3.3.304	That we can call these delicate creatures ours, 
3.3.305	And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad, 
3.3.306	And live upon the vapour of a dungeon, 
3.3.307	Than keep a corner in the thing I love 
3.3.308	For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones; 
3.3.309	Prerogatived are they less than the base; 
3.3.310	'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death: 
3.3.311	Even then this forked plague is fated to us 
3.3.312	When we do quicken. Desdemona comes: Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA. 
3.3.313	If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself! 
3.3.314	I'll not believe 't. 
3.3.315	How now, my dear Othello! 
3.3.316	Your dinner, and the generous islanders 
3.3.317	By you invited, do attend your presence. 
3.3.318	I am to blame. 
3.3.319	Why do you speak so faintly? 
3.3.320	Are you not well? 
3.3.321	I have a pain upon my forehead here. 
3.3.322	'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again: 
3.3.323	Let me but bind it hard, within this hour 
3.3.324	It will be well. 
3.3.325	Your napkin is too little: He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops. 
3.3.326	Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you. 
3.3.327	I am very sorry that you are not well. Exeunt Othello and Desdemona. 
3.3.328	I am glad I have found this napkin: 
3.3.329	This was her first remembrance from the Moor: 
3.3.330	My wayward husband hath a hundred times 
3.3.331	Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token, 
3.3.332	For he conjured her she should ever keep it, 
3.3.333	That she reserves it evermore about her 
3.3.334	To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out, 
3.3.335	And give't Iago: what he will do with it 
3.3.336	Heaven knows, not I; 
3.3.337	I nothing but to please his fantasy. Re-enter IAGO. 
3.3.338	How now! what do you here alone? 
3.3.339	Do not you chide; I have a thing for you. 
3.3.340	A thing for me? it is a common thing-- 
3.3.341	Ha! 
3.3.342	To have a foolish wife. 
3.3.343	O, is that all? What will you give me now 
3.3.344	For that same handkerchief? 
3.3.345	What handkerchief? 
3.3.346	What handkerchief! 
3.3.347	Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona; 
3.3.348	That which so often you did bid me steal. 
3.3.349	Hast stol'n it from her? 
3.3.350	No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence, 
3.3.351	And, to the advantage, I, being here, took 't up. 
3.3.352	Look, here it is. 
3.3.353	A good wench; give it me. 
3.3.354	What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest 
3.3.355	To have me filch it?
3.3.356	Snatching it
3.3.357	Why, what's that to you? 
3.3.358	If it be not for some purpose of import, 
3.3.359	Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad 
3.3.360	When she shall lack it. 
3.3.361	Be not acknown on't; I have use for it. 
3.3.362	Go, leave me. Exit Emilia. 
3.3.363	I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin, 
3.3.364	And let him find it. Trifles light as air 
3.3.365	Are to the jealous confirmations strong 
3.3.366	As proofs of holy writ: ths may do something. 
3.3.367	The Moor already changes with my poison: 
3.3.368	Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons, 
3.3.369	Which at the first are scarce found to distaste, 
3.3.370	But with a little act upon the blood, 
3.3.371	Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so: 
3.3.372	Look, where he comes! Re-enter OTHELLO. 
3.3.373	Not poppy, nor mandragora, 
3.3.374	Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world, 
3.3.375	Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep 
3.3.376	Which thou owedst yesterday. 
3.3.377	Ha! ha! false to me? 
3.3.378	Why, how now, general! no more of that. 
3.3.379	Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack: 
3.3.380	I swear 'tis better to be much abused 
3.3.381	Than but to know't a little. 
3.3.382	How now, my lord! 
3.3.383	What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust? 
3.3.384	I saw 't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me: 
3.3.385	I slept the next night well, was free and merry; 
3.3.386	I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips: 
3.3.387	He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n, 
3.3.388	Let him not know 't, and he 's not robb'd at all. 
3.3.389	I am sorry to hear this. 
3.3.390	I had been happy, if the general camp, 
3.3.391	Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body, 
3.3.392	So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever 
3.3.393	Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content! 
3.3.394	Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars, 
3.3.395	That make ambition virtue! O, farewell! 
3.3.396	Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump, 
3.3.397	The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife, 
3.3.398	The royal banner, and all quality, 
3.3.399	Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war! 
3.3.400	And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats 
3.3.401	The immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit, 
3.3.402	Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone! 
3.3.403	Is't possible, my lord? 
3.3.404	Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore, 
3.3.405	Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof; 
3.3.406	Or, by the worth of man's eternal soul, 
3.3.407	Thou hadst been better have been born a dog 
3.3.408	Than answer my waked wrath! 
3.3.409	Is 't come to this? 
3.3.410	Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it, 
3.3.411	That the probation bear no hinge nor loop 
3.3.412	To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life! 
3.3.413	My noble lord,-- 
3.3.414	If thou dost slander her and torture me, 
3.3.415	Never pray more; abandon all remorse; 
3.3.416	On horror's head horrors accumulate; 
3.3.417	Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed; 
3.3.418	For nothing canst thou to damnation add 
3.3.419	Greater than that. 
3.3.420	O grace! O heaven forgive me! 
3.3.421	Are you a man? have you a soul or sense? 
3.3.422	God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool, 
3.3.423	That livest to make thine honesty a vice! 
3.3.424	O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world, 
3.3.425	To be direct and honest is not safe. 
3.3.426	I thank you for this profit; and from hence 
3.3.427	I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence. 
3.3.428	Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest. 
3.3.429	I should be wise, for honesty's a fool 
3.3.430	And loses that it works for. 
3.3.431	By the world, 
3.3.432	I think my wife be honest and think she is not; 
3.3.433	I think that thou art just and think thou art not. 
3.3.434	I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh 
3.3.435	As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black 
3.3.436	As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives, 
3.3.437	Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams, 
3.3.438	I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied! 
3.3.439	I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion: 
3.3.440	I do repent me that I put it to you. 
3.3.441	You would be satisfied? 
3.3.442	Would! nay, I will. 
3.3.443	And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord? 
3.3.444	Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on- 
3.3.445	Behold her topp'd? 
3.3.446	Death and damnation! O! 
3.3.447	It were a tedious difficulty, I think, 
3.3.448	To bring them to that prospect: damn them then, 
3.3.449	If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster 
3.3.450	More than their own! What then? how then? 
3.3.451	What shall I say? Where's satisfaction? 
3.3.452	It is impossible you should see this, 
3.3.453	Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, 
3.3.454	As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross 
3.3.455	As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say, 
3.3.456	If imputation and strong circumstances, 
3.3.457	Which lead directly to the door of truth, 
3.3.458	Will give you satisfaction, you may have't. 
3.3.459	Give me a living reason she's disloyal. 
3.3.460	I do not like the office: 
3.3.461	But, sith, I am enter'd in this cause so far, 
3.3.462	Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love, 
3.3.463	I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately; 
3.3.464	And, being troubled with a raging tooth, 
3.3.465	I could not sleep. 
3.3.466	There are a kind of men so loose of soul, 
3.3.467	That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs: 
3.3.468	One of this kind is Cassio: 
3.3.469	In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona, 
3.3.470	Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;' 
3.3.471	And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand, 
3.3.472	Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard, 
3.3.473	As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots 
3.3.474	That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg 
3.3.475	Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then 
3.3.476	Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!' 
3.3.477	O monstrous! monstrous! 
3.3.478	Nay, this was but his dream. 
3.3.479	But this denoted a foregone conclusion: 
3.3.480	'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream. 
3.3.481	And this may help to thicken other proofs 
3.3.482	That do demonstrate thinly. 
3.3.483	I'll tear her all to pieces. 
3.3.484	Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done; 
3.3.485	She may be honest yet. Tell me but this, 
3.3.486	Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief 
3.3.487	Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand? 
3.3.488	I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift. 
3.3.489	I know not that: but such a handkerchief-- 
3.3.490	I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day 
3.3.491	See Cassio wipe his beard with. 
3.3.492	If it be that,-- 
3.3.493	If it be that, or any that was hers, 
3.3.494	It speaks against her with the other proofs. 
3.3.495	O, that the slave had forty thousand lives! 
3.3.496	One is too poor, too weak for my revenge. 
3.3.497	Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago; 
3.3.498	All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven. 
3.3.499	'Tis gone. 
3.3.500	Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell 
3.3.501	Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne 
3.3.502	To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, 
3.3.503	For 'tis of aspics' tongues! 
3.3.504	Yet be content. 
3.3.505	O, blood, blood, blood! 
3.3.506	Patience, I say, your mind perhaps may change. 
3.3.507	Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic sea, 
3.3.508	Whose icy current and compulsive course 
3.3.509	Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on 
3.3.510	To the Propontic and the Hellespont, 
3.3.511	Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace, 
3.3.512	Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love, 
3.3.513	Till that a capable and wide revenge 
3.3.514	Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven, Kneels 
3.3.515	In the due reverence of a sacred vow 
3.3.516	I here engage my words. 
3.3.517	Do not rise yet. Kneels 
3.3.518	Witness, you ever-burning lights above, 
3.3.519	You elements that clip us round about, 
3.3.520	Witness that here Iago doth give up 
3.3.521	The execution of his wit, hands, heart, 
3.3.522	To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command, 
3.3.523	And to obey shall be in me remorse, 
3.3.524	What bloody business ever. They rise. 
3.3.525	I greet thy love, 
3.3.526	Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous, 
3.3.527	And will upon the instant put thee to 't: 
3.3.528	Within these three days let me hear thee say 
3.3.529	That Cassio's not alive. 
3.3.530	My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request: 
3.3.531	But let her live. 
3.3.532	Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her! 
3.3.533	Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw, 
3.3.534	To furnish me with some swift means of death 
3.3.535	For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant. 
3.3.536	I am your own for ever. Exeunt.
3.4.1	Before the castle. 
3.4.2	Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown.
3.4.3	Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies? 
3.4.4	I dare not say he lies any where. 
3.4.5	Why, man? 
3.4.6	He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies, is stabbing. 
3.4.7	Go to: where lodges he? 
3.4.8	To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie. 
3.4.9	Can any thing be made of this? 
3.4.10	I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat. 
3.4.11	Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report? 
3.4.12	I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions, and by them answer. 
3.4.13	Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well. 
3.4.14	To do this is within the compass of man's wit; and therefore I will attempt the doing it. Exit. 
3.4.15	Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia? 
3.4.16	I know not, madam. 
3.4.17	Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse 
3.4.18	Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor 
3.4.19	Is true of mind and made of no such baseness 
3.4.20	As jealous creatures are, it were enough 
3.4.21	To put him to ill thinking. 
3.4.22	Is he not jealous? 
3.4.23	Who, he? I think the sun where he was born 
3.4.24	Drew all such humours from him. 
3.4.25	Look, where he comes. 
3.4.26	I will not leave him now till Cassio 
3.4.27	Be call'd to him. Enter OTHELLO. 
3.4.28	How is't with you, my lord? 
3.4.29	Well, my good lady. Aside 
3.4.30	O, hardness to dissemble!-- 
3.4.31	How do you, Desdemona? 
3.4.32	Well, my good lord. 
3.4.33	Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady. 
3.4.34	It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow. 
3.4.35	This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart: 
3.4.36	Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires 
3.4.37	A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer, 
3.4.38	Much castigation, exercise devout; 
3.4.39	For here's a young and sweating devil here, 
3.4.40	That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand, 
3.4.41	A frank one. 
3.4.42	You may, indeed, say so; 
3.4.43	For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart. 
3.4.44	A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands; 
3.4.45	But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts. 
3.4.46	I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise. 
3.4.47	What promise, chuck? 
3.4.48	I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you. 
3.4.49	I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me; 
3.4.50	Lend me thy handkerchief. 
3.4.51	Here, my lord. 
3.4.52	That which I gave you. 
3.4.53	I have it not about me. 
3.4.54	Not? 
3.4.55	No, indeed, my lord. 
3.4.56	That is a fault. 
3.4.57	That handkerchief 
3.4.58	Did an Egyptian to my mother give; 
3.4.59	She was a charmer, and could almost read 
3.4.60	The thoughts of people: she told her, while she kept it, 
3.4.61	'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father 
3.4.62	Entirely to her love, but if she lost it 
3.4.63	Or made a gift of it, my father's eye 
3.4.64	Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt 
3.4.65	After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me; 
3.4.66	And bid me, when my fate would have me wive, 
3.4.67	To give it her. I did so: and take heed on 't; 
3.4.68	Make it a darling like your precious eye; 
3.4.69	To lose't or give't away were such perdition 
3.4.70	As nothing else could match. 
3.4.71	Is't possible? 
3.4.72	'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it: 
3.4.73	A sibyl, that had number'd in the world 
3.4.74	The sun to course two hundred compasses, 
3.4.75	In her prophetic fury sew'd the work; 
3.4.76	The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk; 
3.4.77	And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful 
3.4.78	Conserved of maidens' hearts. 
3.4.79	Indeed! is't true? 
3.4.80	Most veritable; therefore look to 't well. 
3.4.81	Then would to God that I had never seen 't! 
3.4.82	Ha! wherefore? 
3.4.83	Why do you speak so startingly and rash? 
3.4.84	Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way? 
3.4.85	Heaven bless us! 
3.4.86	Say you? 
3.4.87	It is not lost; but what an if it were? 
3.4.88	How! 
3.4.89	I say, it is not lost. 
3.4.90	Fetch 't, let me see 't. 
3.4.91	Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now. 
3.4.92	This is a trick to put me from my suit: 
3.4.93	Pray you, let Cassio be received again. 
3.4.94	Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives. 
3.4.95	Come, come; 
3.4.96	You'll never meet a more sufficient man. 
3.4.97	The handkerchief!
3.4.98	I pray, talk me of Cassio. 
3.4.99	The handkerchief! 
3.4.100	A man that all his time 
3.4.101	Hath founded his good fortunes on your love, 
3.4.102	Shared dangers with you,-- 
3.4.103	The handkerchief! 
3.4.104	In sooth, you are to blame. 
3.4.105	Away! Exit. 
3.4.106	Is not this man jealous? 
3.4.107	I ne'er saw this before. 
3.4.108	Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief: 
3.4.109	I am most unhappy in the loss of it. 
3.4.110	'Tis not a year or two shows us a man: 
3.4.111	They are all but stomachs, and we all but food; 
3.4.112	They eat us hungerly, and when they are full, 
3.4.113	They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband! Enter CAsslo and IAGO. 
3.4.114	There is no other way; 'tis she must do't: 
3.4.115	And, lo, the happiness I go, and importune her. 
3.4.116	How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you? 
3.4.117	Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you 
3.4.118	That by your virtuous means I may again 
3.4.119	Exist, and be a member of his love 
3.4.120	Whom I with all the office of my heart 
3.4.121	Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd. 
3.4.122	If my offence be of such mortal kind 
3.4.123	That nor my service past, nor present sorrows, 
3.4.124	Nor purposed merit in futurity, 
3.4.125	Can ransom me into his love again, 
3.4.126	But to know so must be my benefit; 
3.4.127	So shall I clothe me in a forced content, 
3.4.128	And shut myself up in some other course, 
3.4.129	To fortune's alms. 
3.4.130	Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio! 
3.4.131	My advocation is not now in tune; 
3.4.132	My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him, 
3.4.133	Were he in favour as in humour alter'd. 
3.4.134	So help me every spirit sanctified, 
3.4.135	As I have spoken for you all my best 
3.4.136	And stood within the blank of his displeasure 
3.4.137	For my free speech! you must awhile be patient: 
3.4.138	What I can do I will; and more I will 
3.4.139	Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you. 
3.4.140	Is my lord angry? 
3.4.141	He went hence but now, 
3.4.142	And certainly in strange unquietness. 
3.4.143	Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon, 
3.4.144	When it hath blown his ranks into the air, 
3.4.145	And, like the devil, from his very arm 
3.4.146	Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry? 
3.4.147	Something of moment then: I will go meet him: 
3.4.148	There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry. 
3.4.149	I prithee, do so. Exit Iago.
3.4.150	Something, sure, of state, 
3.4.151	Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practice 
3.4.152	Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him, 
3.4.153	Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases 
3.4.154	Men's natures wrangle with inferior things, 
3.4.155	Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so; 
3.4.156	For let our finger ache, and it indues 
3.4.157	Our other healthful members even to that sense 
3.4.158	Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods, 
3.4.159	Nor of them look for such observances 
3.4.160	As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much. Emilia, 
3.4.161	I was, unhandsome warrior as I am, 
3.4.162	Arraigning his unkindness with my soul; 
3.4.163	But now I find I had suborn'd the witness, 
3.4.164	And he's indicted falsely. 
3.4.165	Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think, 
3.4.166	And no conception nor no jealous toy 
3.4.167	Concerning you. 
3.4.168	Alas the day! I never gave him cause. 
3.4.169	But jealous souls will not be answer'd so; 
3.4.170	They are not ever jealous for the cause, 
3.4.171	But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster 
3.4.172	Begot upon itself, born on itself. 
3.4.173	Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind! 
3.4.174	Lady, amen. 
3.4.175	I will go seek him. Cassio, walk here about: 
3.4.176	If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit 
3.4.177	And seek to effect it to my uttermost. 
3.4.178	I humbly thank your ladyship. Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia. Enter BIANCA. 
3.4.179	Save you, friend Cassio! 
3.4.180	What make you from home? 
3.4.181	How is it with you, my most fair Bianca? 
3.4.182	I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house. 
3.4.183	And I was going to your lodging, Cassio. 
3.4.184	What, keep a week away? seven days and nights? 
3.4.185	Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours, 
3.4.186	More tedious than the dial eight score times? 
3.4.187	O weary reckoning! 
3.4.188	Pardon me, Bianca: 
3.4.189	I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd; 
3.4.190	But I shall, in a more continuate time, 
3.4.191	Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca, Giving her Desdemona's handkerchief. 
3.4.192	Take me this work out. 
3.4.193	O Cassio, whence came this? 
3.4.194	This is some token from a newer friend: 
3.4.195	To the felt absence now I feel a cause: 
3.4.196	Is't come to this? Well, well. 
3.4.197	Go to, woman! 
3.4.198	Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth, 
3.4.199	From whence you have them. You are jealous now 
3.4.200	That this is from some mistress, some remembrance: 
3.4.201	No, in good troth, Bianca. 
3.4.202	Why, whose is it? 
3.4.203	I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber. 
3.4.204	I like the work well: ere it be demanded-- 
3.4.205	As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied: 
3.4.206	Take it, and do 't; and leave me for this time. 
3.4.207	Leave you! wherefore? 
3.4.208	I do attend here on the general; 
3.4.209	And think it no addition, nor my wish, 
3.4.210	To have him see me woman'd. 
3.4.211	Why, I pray you? 
3.4.212	Not that I love you not. 
3.4.213	But that you do not love me. 
3.4.214	I pray you, bring me on the way a little, 
3.4.215	And say if I shall see you soon at night. 
3.4.216	'Tis but a little way that I can bring you; 
3.4.217	For I attend here: but I'll see you soon. 
3.4.218	'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced. Exeunt. 
4.0.0	ACT IV
4.1.1	Cyprus. Before the castle. 
4.1.2	Enter OTHELLO and IAGO.
4.1.3	Will you think so? 
4.1.4	Think so, Iago! 
4.1.5	What, 
4.1.6	To kiss in private? 
4.1.7	An unauthorized kiss. 
4.1.8	Or to be naked with her friend in bed 
4.1.9	An hour or more, not meaning any harm? 
4.1.10	Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm! 
4.1.11	It is hypocrisy against the devil: 
4.1.12	They that mean virtuously, and yet do so, 
4.1.13	The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven. 
4.1.14	So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip: 
4.1.15	But if I give my wife a handkerchief,-- 
4.1.16	What then? 
4.1.17	Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers, 
4.1.18	She may, I think, bestow't on any man. 
4.1.19	She is protectress of her honour too: 
4.1.20	May she give that? 
4.1.21	Her honour is an essence that's not seen; 
4.1.22	They have it very oft that have it not: 
4.1.23	But, for the handkerchief,-- 
4.1.24	By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it. 
4.1.25	Thou said'st--O, it comes o'er my memory, 
4.1.26	As doth the raven o'er the infected house, 
4.1.27	Boding to all--he had my handkerchief. 
4.1.28	Ay, what of that? 
4.1.29	That's not so good now. 
4.1.30	What, 
4.1.31	If I had said I had seen him do you wrong? 
4.1.32	Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad, 
4.1.33	Who having, by their own importunate suit, 
4.1.34	Or voluntary dotage of some mistress, 
4.1.35	Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose 
4.1.36	But they must blab-- 
4.1.37	Hath he said any thing? 
4.1.38	He hath, my lord; but be you well assured, 
4.1.39	No more than he'll unswear. 
4.1.40	What hath he said? 
4.1.41	'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did. 
4.1.42	What? what? 
4.1.43	Lie-- 
4.1.44	With her? 
4.1.45	With her, on her; what you will. 
4.1.46	Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.--Handkerchief--confessions-- handkerchief!--To confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion with- out some instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.-- Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil! Falls in a trance. 
4.1.47	Work on, 
4.1.48	My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught; 
4.1.49	And many worthy and chaste dames even thus, 
4.1.50	All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord! 
4.1.51	My lord, I say! Othello! Enter CASSIO. 
4.1.52	How now, Cassio! 
4.1.53	What's the matter? 
4.1.54	My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy: 
4.1.55	This is his second fit; he had one yesterday. 
4.1.56	Rub him about the temples.
4.1.57	No, forbear; 
4.1.58	The lethargy must have his quiet course: 
4.1.59	If not, he foams at mouth and by and by 
4.1.60	Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs: 
4.1.61	Do you withdraw yourself a little while, 
4.1.62	He will recover straight: when he is gone, 
4.1.63	I would on great occasion speak with you. Exit Cassio, 
4.1.64	How is it, general? have you not hurt your head? 
4.1.65	Dost thou mock me? 
4.1.66	I mock you! no, by heaven. 
4.1.67	Would you would bear your fortune like a man! 
4.1.68	A horned man's a monster and a beast. 
4.1.69	There's many a beast then in a populous city, 
4.1.70	And many a civil monster. 
4.1.71	Did he confess it? 
4.1.72	Good sir, be a man; 
4.1.73	Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked 
4.1.74	May draw with you: there's millions now alive 
4.1.75	That nightly lie in those unproper beds 
4.1.76	Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better. 
4.1.77	O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock, 
4.1.78	To lip a wanton in a secure couch, 
4.1.79	And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know; 
4.1.80	And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be. 
4.1.81	O, thou art wise; 'tis certain. 
4.1.82	Stand you awhile apart; 
4.1.83	Confine yourself but in a patient list. 
4.1.84	Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief-- 
4.1.85	A passion most unsuiting such a man-- 
4.1.86	Cassio came hither: I shifted him away, 
4.1.87	And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy, 
4.1.88	Bade him anon return and here speak with me; 
4.1.89	The which he promised. Do but encave yourself, 
4.1.90	And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns, 
4.1.91	That dwell in every region of his face; 
4.1.92	For I will make him tell the tale anew, 
4.1.93	Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when 
4.1.94	He hath, and is again to cope your wife: 
4.1.95	I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience; 
4.1.96	Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen, 
4.1.97	And nothing of a man. 
4.1.98	Dost thou hear, Iago? 
4.1.99	I will be found most cunning in my patience; 
4.1.100	But--dost thou hear?--most bloody. 
4.1.101	That's not amiss; 
4.1.102	But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw? Othello retires. 
4.1.103	Now will I question Cassio of Bianca, 
4.1.104	A housewife that by selling her desires 
4.1.105	Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature 
4.1.106	That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague 
4.1.107	To beguile many and be beguiled by one: 
4.1.108	He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain 
4.1.109	>From the excess of laughter. Here he comes: Re-enter CASSIO. 
4.1.110	As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad; 
4.1.111	And his unbookish jealousy must construe 
4.1.112	Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behaviour, 
4.1.113	Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant? 
4.1.114	The worser that you give me the addition 
4.1.115	Whose want even kills me. 
4.1.116	Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't. Speaking lower 
4.1.117	Now, if this suit lay in Bianca's power, 
4.1.118	How quickly should you speed! 
4.1.119	Alas, poor caitiff! 
4.1.120	Look, how he laughs already! 
4.1.121	I never knew woman love man so. 
4.1.122	Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me. 
4.1.123	Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out. 
4.1.124	Do you hear, Cassio? 
4.1.125	Now he importunes him 
4.1.126	To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said. 
4.1.127	She gives it out that you shall marry her: 
4.1.128	Do you intend it? 
4.1.129	Ha, ha, ha! 
4.1.130	Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph? 
4.1.131	I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some charity to my wit; do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha! 
4.1.132	So, so, so, so: they laugh that win. 
4.1.133	'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her. 
4.1.134	Prithee, say true. 
4.1.135	I am a very villain else. 
4.1.136	Have you scored me? Well. 
4.1.137	This is the monkey's own giving out: she is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise. 
4.1.138	Iago beckons me; now he begins the story. 
4.1.139	She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble, and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck-- 
4.1.140	Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture imports it. 
4.1.141	So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales, and pulls me: ha, ha, ha! 
4.1.142	Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see that nose of yours. but not that dog I shall throw it to. 
4.1.143	Well, I must leave her company. 
4.1.144	Before me! look, where she comes. 
4.1.145	'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one. Enter BIANCA. 
4.1.146	What do you mean by this haunting of me? 
4.1.147	Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the work?-- A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber, and not know who left it there? This is some minx's token, and I must take out the work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever you had it, I'll take out no work on 't. 
4.1.148	How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now! 
4.1.149	By heaven, that should be my handkerchief! 
4.1.150	An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you will not, come when you are next prepared for. Exit. 
4.1.151	After her, after her. 
4.1.152	'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else. 
4.1.153	Will you sup there? 
4.1.154	'Faith, I intend so. 
4.1.155	Well, I may chance to see you; for 
4.1.156	I would very fain speak with you. 
4.1.157	Prithee, come; will you? 
4.1.158	Go to; say no more. Exit Cassio.
4.1.159	Advancing
4.1.160	How shall I murder him, Iago? 
4.1.161	Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice? 
4.1.162	O Iago! 
4.1.163	And did you see the handkerchief? 
4.1.164	Was that mine? 
4.1.165	Yours, by this hand: and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he hath given it his whore. 
4.1.166	I would have him nine years a- killing. A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman! 
4.1.167	Nay, you must forget that. 
4.1.168	Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night; for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks. 
4.1.169	Nay, that's not your way. 
4.1.170	Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high and plenteous wit and invention: 
4.1.171	She's the worse for all this. 
4.1.172	O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so gentle a condition! 
4.1.173	Ay, too gentle. 
4.1.174	Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago! O Iago, the pity of it, Iago! 
4.1.175	If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody. 
4.1.176	I will chop her into messes: cuckold me! 
4.1.177	O, 'tis foul in her. 
4.1.178	With mine officer! 
4.1.179	That's fouler. 
4.1.180	Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago. 
4.1.181	Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated. 
4.1.182	Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good. 
4.1.183	And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you shall hear more by midnight. 
4.1.184	Excellent good. A trumpet within. 
4.1.185	What trumpet is that same? 
4.1.186	Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico 
4.1.187	Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him. Enter LODOViCO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants. 
4.1.188	Save you, worthy general! 
4.1.189	With all my heart, sir, 
4.1.190	The duke and senators of Venice greet you. Gives him a letter. 
4.1.191	I kiss the instrument of their pleasures. Opens letter, and reads. 
4.1.192	And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico? 
4.1.193	I am very glad to see you, signior; 
4.1.194	Welcome to Cyprus. 
4.1.195	I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio? 
4.1.196	Lives, sir. 
4.1.197	Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord 
4.1.198	An unkind breach: but you shall make all well. 
4.1.199	Are you sure of that? 
4.1.200	My lord?
4.1.201	Reads
4.1.202	'This fail you not to do, as you will--' 
4.1.203	He did not call; he's busy in the paper. 
4.1.204	Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio? 
4.1.205	A most unhappy one: I would do much 
4.1.206	To atone them, for the love I bear Cassio. 
4.1.207	Fire and brimstone! 
4.1.208	My lord? 
4.1.209	Are you wise? 
4.1.210	What, is he angry? 
4.1.211	May be the letter moved him; 
4.1.212	For, as I think, they do command him home, 
4.1.213	Deputing Cassio in his government. 
4.1.214	Trust me, I am glad on't. 
4.1.215	Indeed! 
4.1.216	My lord? 
4.1.217	I am glad to see you mad. 
4.1.218	Why, sweet Othello,--
4.1.219	Striking her
4.1.220	Devil! 
4.1.221	I have not deserved this. 
4.1.222	My lord, this would not be believed in Venice, 
4.1.223	Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much: 
4.1.224	Make her amends; she weeps. 
4.1.225	O devil, devil! 
4.1.226	If that the earth could teem with woman's tears, 
4.1.227	Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile. 
4.1.228	Out of my sight! 
4.1.229	I will not stay to offend you. Going. 
4.1.230	Truly, an obedient lady: 
4.1.231	I do beseech your lordship, call her back. 
4.1.232	Mistress! 
4.1.233	My lord? 
4.1.234	What would you with her, sir? 
4.1.235	Who, I, my lord? 
4.1.236	Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn: 
4.1.237	Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on, 
4.1.238	And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep; 
4.1.239	And she's obedient, as you say, obedient, 
4.1.240	Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears. 
4.1.241	Concerning this, sir,--O well-painted passion!-- 
4.1.242	I am commanded home. Get you away; 
4.1.243	I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate, 
4.1.244	And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt! Exit Desdemona. 
4.1.245	Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight, 
4.1.246	I do entreat that we may sup together: 
4.1.247	You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys! Exit. 
4.1.248	Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate 
4.1.249	Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature 
4.1.250	Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue 
4.1.251	The shot of accident, nor dart of chance, 
4.1.252	Could neither graze nor pierce? 
4.1.253	He is much changed. 
4.1.254	Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain? 
4.1.255	He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure 
4.1.256	What he might be: if what he might he is not, 
4.1.257	I would to heaven he were! 
4.1.258	What, strike his wife! 
4.1.259	'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew 
4.1.260	That stroke would prove the worst! 
4.1.261	Is it his use? 
4.1.262	Or did the letters work upon his blood, 
4.1.263	And new-create this fault? 
4.1.264	Alas, alas! 
4.1.265	It is not honesty in me to speak 
4.1.266	What I have seen and known. You shall observe him, 
4.1.267	And his own courses will denote him so 
4.1.268	That I may save my speech: do but go after, 
4.1.269	And mark how he continues. 
4.1.270	I am sorry that I am deceived in him. Exeunt.
4.2.1	A room in the castle.
4.2.2	Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA. 
4.2.3	You have seen nothing then? 
4.2.4	Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect. 
4.2.5	Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together. 
4.2.6	But then I saw no harm, and then I heard 
4.2.7	Each syllable that breath made up between them. 
4.2.8	What, did they never whisper? 
4.2.9	Never, my lord. 
4.2.10	Nor send you out o' the way? 
4.2.11	Never. 
4.2.12	To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing? 
4.2.13	Never, my lord. 
4.2.14	That's strange. 
4.2.15	I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest, 
4.2.16	Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other, 
4.2.17	Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom. 
4.2.18	If any wretch have put this in your head, 
4.2.19	Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse! 
4.2.20	For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true, 
4.2.21	There's no man happy; the purest of their wives 
4.2.22	Is foul as slander. 
4.2.23	Bid her come hither: go. Exit Emilia. 
4.2.24	She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd 
4.2.25	That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore, 
4.2.26	A closet lock and key of villanous secrets: 
4.2.27	And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't. Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA. 
4.2.28	My lord, what is your will? 
4.2.29	Pray, chuck, come hither. 
4.2.30	What is your pleasure? 
4.2.31	Let me see your eyes; 
4.2.32	Look in my face. 
4.2.33	What horrible fancy's this?
4.2.34	To Emilia
4.2.35	Some of your function, mistress; 
4.2.36	Leave procreants alone and shut the door; 
4.2.37	Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come: 
4.2.38	Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch. Exit Emilia. 
4.2.39	Upon my knees, what doth your speech import? 
4.2.40	I understand a fury in your words, 
4.2.41	But not the words. 
4.2.42	Why, what art thou? 
4.2.43	Your wife, my lord; your true 
4.2.44	And loyal wife. 
4.2.45	Come, swear it, damn thyself; 
4.2.46	Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves 
4.2.47	Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd: 
4.2.48	Swear thou art honest. 
4.2.49	Heaven doth truly know it. 
4.2.50	Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell. 
4.2.51	To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false? 
4.2.52	O Desdemona! away! away! away! 
4.2.53	Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep? 
4.2.54	Am I the motive of these tears, my lord? 
4.2.55	If haply you my father do suspect 
4.2.56	An instrument of this your calling back, 
4.2.57	Lay not your blame on me: if you have lost him, 
4.2.58	Why, I have lost him too. 
4.2.59	Had it pleased heaven 
4.2.60	To try me with affliction; had they rain'd 
4.2.61	All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head, 
4.2.62	Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips, 
4.2.63	Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes, 
4.2.64	I should have found in some place of my soul 
4.2.65	A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me 
4.2.66	A fixed figure for the time of scorn 
4.2.67	To point his slow unmoving finger at! 
4.2.68	Yet could I bear that too; well, very well: 
4.2.69	But there, where I have garner'd up my heart, 
4.2.70	Where either I must live, or bear no life; 
4.2.71	The fountain from the which my current runs, 
4.2.72	Or else dries up; to be discarded thence! 
4.2.73	Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads 
4.2.74	To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there, 
4.2.75	Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,-- 
4.2.76	Ay, there, look grim as hell! 
4.2.77	I hope my noble lord esteems me honest. 
4.2.78	O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles, 
4.2.79	That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed, 
4.2.80	Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet 
4.2.81	That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born! 
4.2.82	Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed? 
4.2.83	Was this fair paper, this most goodly book, 
4.2.84	Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed! 
4.2.85	Committed! O thou public commoner! 
4.2.86	I should make very forges of my cheeks, 
4.2.87	That would to cinders burn up modesty, 
4.2.88	Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed! 
4.2.89	Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks, 
4.2.90	The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets 
4.2.91	Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth. 
4.2.92	And will not hear it. What committed! 
4.2.93	Impudent strumpet! 
4.2.94	By heaven, you do me wrong. 
4.2.95	Are not you a strumpet? 
4.2.96	No, as I am a Christian: 
4.2.97	If to preserve this vessel for my lord 
4.2.98	>From any other foul unlawful touch 
4.2.99	Be not to be a strumpet, I am none. 
4.2.100	What, not a whore? 
4.2.101	No, as I shall be saved. 
4.2.102	Is't possible? 
4.2.103	O, heaven forgive us! 
4.2.104	I cry you mercy, then: 
4.2.105	I took you for that cunning whore of Venice 
4.2.106	That married with Othello. Raising his voice 
4.2.107	You, mistress, 
4.2.108	That have the office opposite to Saint Peter, 
4.2.109	And keep the gate of hell! Re-enter EMILIA.
4.2.110	You, you, ay, you! 
4.2.111	We have done our course; there's money for your pains: 
4.2.112	I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel. Exit. 
4.2.113	Alas, what does this gentleman conceive? 
4.2.114	How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady? 
4.2.115	Faith, half asleep. 
4.2.116	Good madam, what's the matter with my lord? 
4.2.117	With who? 
4.2.118	Why, with my lord, madam. 
4.2.119	Who is thy lord? 
4.2.120	He that is yours, sweet lady. 
4.2.121	I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia; 
4.2.122	I cannot weep; nor answer have I none, 
4.2.123	But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight 
4.2.124	Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember; 
4.2.125	And call thy husband hither. 
4.2.126	Here's a change indeed! Exit. 
4.2.127	'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet. 
4.2.128	How have I been behaved, that he might stick 
4.2.129	The small'st opinion on my least misuse? Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO. 
4.2.130	What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you? 
4.2.131	I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes 
4.2.132	Do it with gentle means and easy tasks: 
4.2.133	He might have chid me so; for, in good faith, 
4.2.134	I am a child to chiding. 
4.2.135	What's the matter, lady? 
4.2.136	Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her, 
4.2.137	Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her, 
4.2.138	As true hearts cannot bear. 
4.2.139	Am I that name, Iago? 
4.2.140	What name, fair lady? 
4.2.141	Such as she says my lord did say I was. 
4.2.142	He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink 
4.2.143	Could not have laid such terms upon his callet. 
4.2.144	Why did he so? 
4.2.145	I do not know; I am sure I am none such. 
4.2.146	Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day! 
4.2.147	Hath she forsook so many noble matches, 
4.2.148	Her father and her country and her friends, 
4.2.149	To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep? 
4.2.150	It is my wretched fortune. 
4.2.151	Beshrew him for't! 
4.2.152	How comes this trick upon him? 
4.2.153	Nay, heaven doth know. 
4.2.154	I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain, 
4.2.155	Some busy and insinuating rogue, 
4.2.156	Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office, 
4.2.157	Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else. 
4.2.158	Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible. 
4.2.159	If any such there be, heaven pardon him! 
4.2.160	A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones! 
4.2.161	Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company? 
4.2.162	What place? what time? what form? what likelihood? 
4.2.163	The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave, 
4.2.164	Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow. 
4.2.165	O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold, 
4.2.166	And put in every honest hand a whip 
4.2.167	To lash the rascals naked through the world 
4.2.168	Even from the east to the west! 
4.2.169	Speak within door. 
4.2.170	O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was 
4.2.171	That turn'd your wit the seamy side without, 
4.2.172	And made you to suspect me with the Moor. 
4.2.173	You are a fool; go to. 
4.2.174	O good Iago, 
4.2.175	What shall I do to win my lord again? 
4.2.176	Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven, 
4.2.177	I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel: 
4.2.178	If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love, 
4.2.179	Either in discourse of thought or actual deed, 
4.2.180	Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense, 
4.2.181	Delighted them in any other form; 
4.2.182	Or that I do not yet, and ever did, 
4.2.183	And ever will--though he do shake me off 
4.2.184	To beggarly divorcement:--love him dearly, 
4.2.185	Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much; 
4.2.186	And his unkindness may defeat my life, 
4.2.187	But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:' 
4.2.188	It doth abhor me now I speak the word; 
4.2.189	To do the act that might the addition earn 
4.2.190	Not the world's mass of vanity could make me. 
4.2.191	I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour: 
4.2.192	The business of the state does him offence, 
4.2.193	And he does chide with you. 
4.2.194	If 'twere no other,-- 
4.2.195	'Tis but so, I warrant. Trumpets within. 
4.2.196	Hark, how these instruments summon to supper! 
4.2.197	The messengers of Venice stay the meat: 
4.2.198	Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well. Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia. Enter RODERIGO. 
4.2.199	How now, Roderigo! 
4.2.200	I do not find that thou dealest justly with me. 
4.2.201	What in the contrary? 
4.2.202	Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered. 
4.2.203	Will you hear me, Roderigo? 
4.2.204	'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and performances are no kin together. 
4.2.205	You charge me most unjustly. 
4.2.206	With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist: you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none. 
4.2.207	Well; go to; very well. 
4.2.208	Very well! go to! I cannot go to man; nor 'tis not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it. 
4.2.209	Very well. 
4.2.210	I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona: if she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you. 
4.2.211	You have said now. 
4.2.212	Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing. 
4.2.213	Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair. 
4.2.214	It hath not appeared. 
4.2.215	I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgement. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life. 
4.2.216	Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass? 
4.2.217	Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place. 
4.2.218	Is that true? why, then Othello and 
4.2.219	Desdemona return again to Venice. 
4.2.220	O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio. 
4.2.221	How do you mean, removing of him? 
4.2.222	Why, by making him uncapable of 
4.2.223	Othello's place; knocking out his brains. 
4.2.224	And that you would have me to do? 
4.2.225	Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups to-night with a harlotry and thither will I go to him: he knows not yet of his honourable fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to waste: about it. 
4.2.226	I will hear further reason for this. 
4.2.227	And you shall be satisfied. Exeunt.
4.3.1	Another room in the castle. 
4.3.2	Enter OTHELLO, LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Attendants.
4.3.3	I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further. 
4.3.4	O, pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk. 
4.3.5	Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship. 
4.3.6	Your honour is most welcome. 
4.3.7	Will you walk, sir? 
4.3.8	O,--Desdemona,-- 
4.3.9	My lord? 
4.3.10	Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done. 
4.3.11	I will, my lord. Exeunt Othello, Lodovico, and Attendants. 
4.3.12	How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did. 
4.3.13	He says he will return incontinent: 
4.3.14	He hath commanded me to go to bed, 
4.3.15	And bade me to dismiss you. 
4.3.16	Dismiss me! 
4.3.17	It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia, 
4.3.18	Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu: 
4.3.19	We must not now displease him. 
4.3.20	I would you had never seen him! 
4.3.21	So would not I: my love doth so approve him, 
4.3.22	That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns,-- 
4.3.23	Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them. 
4.3.24	I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed. 
4.3.25	All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds! 
4.3.26	If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me 
4.3.27	In one of those same sheets. 
4.3.28	Come, come, you talk. 
4.3.29	My mother had a maid call'd Barbara: 
4.3.30	She was in love, and he she loved proved mad 
4.3.31	And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;' 
4.3.32	An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune, 
4.3.33	And she died singing it: that song to-night 
4.3.34	Will not go from my mind; I have much to do, 
4.3.35	But to go hang my head all at one side, 
4.3.36	And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch. 
4.3.37	Shall I go fetch your night-gown? 
4.3.38	No, unpin me here. 
4.3.39	This Lodovico is a proper man. 
4.3.40	A very handsome man. 
4.3.41	He speaks well. 
4.3.42	I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
4.3.43	Singing
4.3.44	The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree, 
4.3.45	Sing all a green willow; 
4.3.46	Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee, 
4.3.47	Sing willow, willow, willow: 
4.3.48	The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans; 
4.3.49	Sing willow, willow, willow; 
4.3.50	Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones; 
4.3.51	Lay by these:-- Singing 
4.3.52	Sing willow, willow, willow; 
4.3.53	Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:-- Singing 
4.3.54	Sing all a green willow must be my garland. 
4.3.55	Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,-- 
4.3.56	Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks? 
4.3.57	It's the wind.
4.3.58	Singing
4.3.59	I call'd my love false love; but what said he then? 
4.3.60	Sing willow, willow, willow: 
4.3.61	If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men.-- 
4.3.62	So, get thee gone; good night. Mine eyes do itch; 
4.3.63	Doth that bode weeping? 
4.3.64	'Tis neither here nor there. 
4.3.65	I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men! 
4.3.66	Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,-- 
4.3.67	That there be women do abuse their husbands 
4.3.68	In such gross kind? 
4.3.69	There be some such, no question. 
4.3.70	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? 
4.3.71	Why, would not you? 
4.3.72	No, by this heavenly light! 
4.3.73	Nor I neither by this heavenly light; 
4.3.74	I might do't as well i' the dark. 
4.3.75	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? 
4.3.76	The world's a huge thing: it is a great price 
4.3.77	For a small vice. 
4.3.78	In troth, I think thou wouldst not. 
4.3.79	In troth, I think I should; and un- do't when I had done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but, for the whole world,--why, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for't. 
4.3.80	Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong 
4.3.81	For the whole world. 
4.3.82	Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right. 
4.3.83	I do not think there is any such woman. 
4.3.84	Yes, a dozen; and as many to the 
4.3.85	Vantage as would store the world they played for. 
4.3.86	But I do think it is their husbands' faults 
4.3.87	If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties, 
4.3.88	And pour our treasures into foreign laps, 
4.3.89	Or else break out in peevish jealousies, 
4.3.90	Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us, 
4.3.91	Or scant our former having in despite; 
4.3.92	Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace, 
4.3.93	Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know 
4.3.94	Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell 
4.3.95	And have their palates both for sweet and sour, 
4.3.96	As husbands have. What is it that they do 
4.3.97	When they change us for others? Is it sport? 
4.3.98	I think it is: and doth affection breed it? 
4.3.99	I think it doth: is 't frailty that thus errs? 
4.3.100	It is so too: and have not we affections, 
4.3.101	Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have? 
4.3.102	Then let them use us well: else let them know, 
4.3.103	The ills we do, their ills instruct us so. 
4.3.104	Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send, 
4.3.105	Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend! Exeunt,
5.0.0	ACT V
5.1.1	Cyprus. A street. 
5.1.2	Enter IAGO and RODERIGO.
5.1.3	Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come: 
5.1.4	Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home: 
5.1.5	Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow: 
5.1.6	It makes us, or it mars us; think on that, 
5.1.7	And fix most firm thy resolution. 
5.1.8	Be near at hand; I may miscarry in 't. 
5.1.9	Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand. Retires. 
5.1.10	I have no great devotion to the deed; 
5.1.11	And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons: 
5.1.12	'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies. 
5.1.13	I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense, 
5.1.14	And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio, 
5.1.15	Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other, 
5.1.16	Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo, 
5.1.17	He calls me to a restitution large 
5.1.18	Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him, 
5.1.19	As gifts to Desdemona; 
5.1.20	It must not be: if Cassio do remain, 
5.1.21	He hath a daily beauty in his life 
5.1.22	That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor 
5.1.23	May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril: 
5.1.24	No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming. Enter CASSIO. 
5.1.25	I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest! Makes a pass at Cassio. 
5.1.26	That thrust had been mine enemy indeed, 
5.1.27	But that my coat is better than thou know'st: 
5.1.28	I will make proof of thine. Draws, and wounds Roderigo. 
5.1.29	O, I am slain! Iago from behind wounds Cassio in the leg, and exit. 
5.1.30	I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder! Falls. Enter OTHELLO. 
5.1.31	The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word. 
5.1.32	O, villain that I am! 
5.1.33	It is even so. 
5.1.34	O, help, ho! light! a surgeon! 
5.1.35	'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just, 
5.1.36	That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong! 
5.1.37	Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead, 
5.1.38	And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come. 
5.1.39	Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted; 
5.1.40	Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted. Exit. Enter LODOVlCO and GRATIANO. 
5.1.41	What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder! 
5.1.42	'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful. 
5.1.43	O, help! 
5.1.44	Hark! 
5.1.45	O wretched villains! 
5.1.46	Two or three groan: it is a heavy night: 
5.1.47	These may be counterfeits: let's think 't unsafe 
5.1.48	To come in to the cry without more help. 
5.1.49	Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death. 
5.1.50	Hark! Re-enter IAGO, with a light. 
5.1.51	Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons. 
5.1.52	Who's there? whose noise is this that cries on murder? 
5.1.53	We do not know. 
5.1.54	Did not you hear a cry? 
5.1.55	Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me! 
5.1.56	What's the matter? 
5.1.57	This is Othello's ancient, as I take it. 
5.1.58	The same indeed; a very valiant fellow. 
5.1.59	What are you here that cry so grievously? 
5.1.60	Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains! 
5.1.61	Give me some help. 
5.1.62	O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this? 
5.1.63	I think that one of them is hereabout, 
5.1.64	And cannot make away. 
5.1.65	O treacherous villains! 
5.1.66	What are you there? come in, and give some help. To Lodovico and Gratiano, 
5.1.67	O, help me here! 
5.1.68	That's one of them. 
5.1.69	O murderous slave! O villain! Stabs Roderigo, 
5.1.70	O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog! 
5.1.71	Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?-- 
5.1.72	How silent is this town! Ho! murder! murder!-- 
5.1.73	What may you be? are you of good or evil? 
5.1.74	As you shall prove us, praise us. 
5.1.75	Signior Lodovico? 
5.1.76	He, sir. 
5.1.77	I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains. 
5.1.78	Cassio! 
5.1.79	How is 't, brother! 
5.1.80	My leg is cut in two. 
5.1.81	Marry, heaven forbid! 
5.1.82	Light, gentlemen: I'll bind it with my shirt. Enter BIANCA. 
5.1.83	What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried? 
5.1.84	Who is't that cried! 
5.1.85	O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! 
5.1.86	O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio! 
5.1.87	O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect 
5.1.88	Who they should be that have thus mangled you? 
5.1.89	No. 
5.1.90	I am sorry to find you thus: I have been to seek you. 
5.1.91	Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair, 
5.1.92	To bear him easily hence! 
5.1.93	Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio! 
5.1.94	Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash 
5.1.95	To be a party in this injury. 
5.1.96	Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come; 
5.1.97	Lend me a light. Know we this face or no? 
5.1.98	Alas, my friend and my dear countryman 
5.1.99	Roderigo! no:--yes, sure:--O heaven! Roderigo. 
5.1.100	What, of Venice? 
5.1.101	Even he, sir: did you know him? 
5.1.102	Know him! ay. 
5.1.103	Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon; 
5.1.104	These bloody accidents must excuse my manners, 
5.1.105	That so neglected you. 
5.1.106	I am glad to see you. 
5.1.107	How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair! 
5.1.108	Roderigo! 
5.1.109	He, he, 'tis he. A chair brought in. 
5.1.110	O, that's well said; the chair. 
5.1.111	Some good man bear him carefully from hence; 
5.1.112	I'll fetch the general's surgeon. To Bianca 
5.1.113	For you, mistress, 
5.1.114	Save you your labour. He that lies slain here, Cassio, 
5.1.115	Was my dear friend: what malice was between you? 
5.1.116	None in the world; nor do I know the man.
5.1.117	To Bian.
5.1.118	What, look you pale? 
5.1.119	O, bear him out o' the air. Cassio and Roderigo are borne off. 
5.1.120	Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress? 
5.1.121	Do you perceive the gastness of her eye? 
5.1.122	Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon. 
5.1.123	Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her: 
5.1.124	Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak, 
5.1.125	Though tongues were out of use. Enter EMILIA. 
5.1.126	'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband? 
5.1.127	Cassio hath here been set on in the dark 
5.1.128	By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped: 
5.1.129	He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead. 
5.1.130	Alas, good gentlemen alas, good Cassio! 
5.1.131	This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia, 
5.1.132	Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night. To Bianca 
5.1.133	What, do you shake at that? 
5.1.134	He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not. 
5.1.135	O, did he so? I charge you, go with me. 
5.1.136	Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet! 
5.1.137	I am no strumpet; but of life as honest 
5.1.138	As you that thus abuse me. 
5.1.139	As I! foh! fie upon thee! 
5.1.140	Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd. 
5.1.141	Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale. 
5.1.142	Emilia, run you to the citadel, 
5.1.143	And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd. 
5.1.144	Will you go on? I pray. Aside 
5.1.145	This is the night 
5.1.146	That either makes me or fordoes me quite. Exeunt.
5.2.1	A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep; a light burning. 
5.2.2	Enter OTHELLO.
5.2.3	It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,-- 
5.2.4	Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!-- 
5.2.5	It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood. 
5.2.6	Nor scar that whiter skin of her than snow, 
5.2.7	And smooth as monumental alabaster. 
5.2.8	Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men. 
5.2.9	Put out the light, and then put out the light: 
5.2.10	If I quench thee, thou flaming minister, 
5.2.11	I can again thy former light restore, 
5.2.12	Should I repent me: but once put out thy light, 
5.2.13	Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature, 
5.2.14	I know not where is that Promethean heat 
5.2.15	That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose, 
5.2.16	I cannot give it vital growth again, 
5.2.17	It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree. Kissing her. 
5.2.18	Ah, balmy breath, that doth almost persuade 
5.2.19	Justice to break her sword! One more, one more. 
5.2.20	Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee, 
5.2.21	And love thee after. One more, and this the last: 
5.2.22	So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep, 
5.2.23	But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly; 
5.2.24	It strikes where it doth love. She wakes. 
5.2.25	Who's there? Othello? 
5.2.26	Ay, Desdemona. 
5.2.27	Will you come to bed, my lord? 
5.2.28	Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona? 
5.2.29	Ay, my lord. 
5.2.30	If you bethink yourself of any crime 
5.2.31	Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace, 
5.2.32	Solicit for it straight. 
5.2.33	Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that? 
5.2.34	Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by: 
5.2.35	I would not kill thy unprepared spirit; 
5.2.36	No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul. 
5.2.37	Talk you of killing? 
5.2.38	Ay, I do. 
5.2.39	Then heaven 
5.2.40	Have mercy on me! 
5.2.41	Amen, with all my heart! 
5.2.42	If you say so, I hope you will not kill me. 
5.2.43	Hum! 
5.2.44	And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then 
5.2.45	When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not, 
5.2.46	Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear. 
5.2.47	Think on thy sins. 
5.2.48	They are loves I bear to you. 
5.2.49	Ay, and for that thou diest. 
5.2.50	That death's unnatural that kills for loving. 
5.2.51	Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip? 
5.2.52	Some bloody passion shakes your very frame: 
5.2.53	These are portents: but yet I hope, I hope, 
5.2.54	They do not point on me. 
5.2.55	Peace, and be still! 
5.2.56	I will so. What's the matter? 
5.2.57	That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee 
5.2.58	Thou gavest to Cassio. 
5.2.59	No, by my life and soul! 
5.2.60	Send for the man, and ask him. 
5.2.61	Sweet soul, take heed, 
5.2.62	Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed. 
5.2.63	Ay, but not yet to die. 
5.2.64	Yes, presently: 
5.2.65	Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin; 
5.2.66	For to deny each article with oath 
5.2.67	Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception 
5.2.68	That I do groan withal. Thou art to die. 
5.2.69	Then Lord have mercy on me! 
5.2.70	I say, amen. 
5.2.71	And have you mercy too! I never did 
5.2.72	Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio 
5.2.73	But with such general warranty of heaven 
5.2.74	As I might love; I never gave him token. 
5.2.75	By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand. 
5.2.76	O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart, 
5.2.77	And makest me call what I intended to do 
5.2.78	A murder, which I thought a sacrifice: 
5.2.79	I saw the handkerchief. 
5.2.80	He found it then; 
5.2.81	I never gave it him: send for him hither; 
5.2.82	Let him confess a truth. 
5.2.83	He hath confess'd. 
5.2.84	What, my lord? 
5.2.85	That he hath used thee. 
5.2.86	How? unlawfully? 
5.2.87	Ay. 
5.2.88	He will not say so. 
5.2.89	No, his mouth is stopp'd; 
5.2.90	Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't. 
5.2.91	O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead? 
5.2.92	Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge 
5.2.93	Had stomach for them all. 
5.2.94	Alas! he is betray'd and I undone. 
5.2.95	Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face? 
5.2.96	O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not! 
5.2.97	Down, strumpet! 
5.2.98	Kill me to-morrow: let me live tonight! 
5.2.99	Nay, if you strive,-- 
5.2.100	But half an hour! 
5.2.101	Being done, there is no pause. 
5.2.102	But while I say one prayer! 
5.2.103	It is too late. He stifles her. 
5.2.104	Within
5.2.105	My lord, my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord! 
5.2.106	What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead? 
5.2.107	I that am cruel am yet merciful; 
5.2.108	I would not have thee linger in thy pain: 
5.2.109	So, so.
5.2.110	Within
5.2.111	What, ho! my lord, my lord! 
5.2.112	Who's there?
5.2.113	Within
5.2.114	O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you! 
5.2.115	Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead. 
5.2.116	'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death. 
5.2.117	The noise was here. Ha! no more moving? 
5.2.118	Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good ?-- 
5.2.119	I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do? 
5.2.120	If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife: 
5.2.121	My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife. 
5.2.122	O, insupportable! O heavy hour! 
5.2.123	Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse 
5.2.124	Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe 
5.2.125	Should yawn at alteration.
5.2.126	Within
5.2.127	I do beseech you 
5.2.128	That I may speak with you, O, good my lord! 
5.2.129	I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia: 
5.2.130	Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw. 
5.2.131	Where art thou? Unlocks the door. Enter EMILIA.
5.2.132	What's the matter with thee now? 
5.2.133	O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done! 
5.2.134	 
5.2.135	But now, my lord. 
5.2.136	It is the very error of the moon; 
5.2.137	She comes more nearer earth than she was wont, 
5.2.138	And makes men mad. 
5.2.139	Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian 
5.2.140	Call'd Roderigo. 
5.2.141	Roderigo kill'd! 
5.2.142	And Cassio kill'd! 
5.2.143	No, Cassio is not kill'd. 
5.2.144	Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune, 
5.2.145	And sweet revenge grows harsh. 
5.2.146	O, falsely, falsely murder'd! 
5.2.147	Alas, what cry is that? 
5.2.148	That! what? 
5.2.149	Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice. 
5.2.150	Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again! 
5.2.151	Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak! 
5.2.152	A guiltless death I die. 
5.2.153	O, who hath done this deed? 
5.2.154	Nobody; I myself. Farewell: 
5.2.155	Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell! Dies. 
5.2.156	Why, how should she be murder'd? 
5.2.157	Alas, who knows? 
5.2.158	You heard her say herself, it was not I. 
5.2.159	She said so: I must needs report the truth. 
5.2.160	She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell: 
5.2.161	'Twas I that kill'd her. 
5.2.162	O, the more angel she, 
5.2.163	And you the blacker devil! 
5.2.164	She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore. 
5.2.165	Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil. 
5.2.166	She was false as water. 
5.2.167	Thou art rash as fire, to say 
5.2.168	That she was false: O, she was heavenly true! 
5.2.169	Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else. 
5.2.170	O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell, 
5.2.171	But that I did proceed upon just grounds 
5.2.172	To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all. 
5.2.173	My husband! 
5.2.174	Thy husband. 
5.2.175	That she was false to wedlock? 
5.2.176	Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true, 
5.2.177	If heaven would make me such another world 
5.2.178	Of one entire and perfect chrysolite, 
5.2.179	I'ld not have sold her for it. 
5.2.180	My husband! 
5.2.181	Ay, 'twas he that told me first: 
5.2.182	An honest man he is, and hates the slime 
5.2.183	That sticks on filthy deeds. 
5.2.184	My husband! 
5.2.185	What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband. 
5.2.186	O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love! 
5.2.187	My husband say that she was false! 
5.2.188	He, woman; 
5.2.189	I say thy husband: dost understand the word? 
5.2.190	My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago. 
5.2.191	If he say so, may his pernicious soul 
5.2.192	Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart: 
5.2.193	She was too fond of her most filthy bargain. 
5.2.194	Ha! 
5.2.195	Do thy worst: 
5.2.196	This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven 
5.2.197	Than thou wast worthy her. 
5.2.198	Peace, you were best. 
5.2.199	Thou hast not half that power to do me harm 
5.2.200	As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt! 
5.2.201	As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed-- 
5.2.202	I care not for thy sword: I'll make thee known, 
5.2.203	Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help! 
5.2.204	The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder! Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others. 
5.2.205	What is the matter? How now, general! 
5.2.206	O, are you come, Iago? you have done well, 
5.2.207	That men must lay their murders on your neck. 
5.2.208	What is the matter? 
5.2.209	Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man: 
5.2.210	He says thou told'st him that his wife was false: 
5.2.211	I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain: 
5.2.212	Speak, for my heart is full. 
5.2.213	I told him what I thought, and told no more 
5.2.214	Than what he found himself was apt and true. 
5.2.215	But did you ever tell him she was false? 
5.2.216	I did. 
5.2.217	You told a lie; an odious, damned lie; 
5.2.218	Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie. 
5.2.219	She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio? 
5.2.220	With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue. 
5.2.221	I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak: 
5.2.222	My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,-- 
5.2.223	O heavens forfend! 
5.2.224	And your reports have set the murder on. 
5.2.225	Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed. 
5.2.226	'Tis a strange truth. 
5.2.227	O monstrous act! 
5.2.228	Villany, villany, villany! 
5.2.229	I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!-- 
5.2.230	I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:-- 
5.2.231	O villany. villany! 
5.2.232	What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home. 
5.2.233	Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak: 
5.2.234	'Tis proper I obey him, but not now. 
5.2.235	Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home. 
5.2.236	O! O! O! He falls on the bed. 
5.2.237	Nay, lay thee down and roar; 
5.2.238	For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent 
5.2.239	That e'er did lift up eye.
5.2.240	Rising
5.2.241	O, she was foul! 
5.2.242	I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece, 
5.2.243	Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd: 
5.2.244	I know this act shows horrible and grim. 
5.2.245	Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead: 
5.2.246	Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief 
5.2.247	Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now, 
5.2.248	This sight would make him do a desperate turn, 
5.2.249	Yea, curse his better angel from his side, 
5.2.250	And fall to reprobation. 
5.2.251	'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows 
5.2.252	That she with Cassio hath the act of shame 
5.2.253	A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it: 
5.2.254	And she did gratify his amorous works 
5.2.255	With that recognizance and pledge of love 
5.2.256	Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand: 
5.2.257	It was a handkerchief, an antique token 
5.2.258	My father gave my mother. 
5.2.259	O heaven! O heavenly powers! 
5.2.260	Come, hold your peace. 
5.2.261	'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace! 
5.2.262	No, I will speak as liberal as the north: 
5.2.263	Let heaven and men and devils, let them all, 
5.2.264	All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak. 
5.2.265	Be wise, and get you home. 
5.2.266	I will not. Iago offers to stab Emilia. 
5.2.267	Fie! 
5.2.268	Your sword upon a woman? 
5.2.269	O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of 
5.2.270	I found by fortune and did give my husband; 
5.2.271	For often, with a solemn earnestness, 
5.2.272	More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle, 
5.2.273	He begg'd of me to steal it. 
5.2.274	Villanous whore! 
5.2.275	She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it, 
5.2.276	And I did give't my husband. 
5.2.277	Filth, thou liest! 
5.2.278	By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen. 
5.2.279	O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool 
5.2.280	Do with so good a woman? 
5.2.281	Are there no stones in heaven 
5.2.282	But what serve for the thunder? Precious villain! He runs at Iago: Iago, from behind, stabs Emilia, and exit. 
5.2.283	The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife. 
5.2.284	Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side. 
5.2.285	He's gone, but his wife's kill'd. 
5.2.286	'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon, 
5.2.287	Which I have here recover'd from the Moor: 
5.2.288	Come, guard the door without; let him not pass, 
5.2.289	But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain, 
5.2.290	For 'tis a damned slave. Exeunt Montana and Cratiano. 
5.2.291	I am not valiant neither, 
5.2.292	But every puny whipster gets my sword: 
5.2.293	But why should honour outlive honesty? 
5.2.294	Let it go all. 
5.2.295	What did thy song bode, lady. 
5.2.296	Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan, 
5.2.297	And die in music. Singing 
5.2.298	Willow, willow, willow.-- 
5.2.299	Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor; 
5.2.300	So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true; 
5.2.301	So speaking as I think, I die, I die. Dies. 
5.2.302	I have another weapon in this chamber; 
5.2.303	It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper: 
5.2.304	O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.
5.2.305	Within
5.2.306	If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear: 
5.2.307	Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer. 
5.2.308	Look in upon me then and speak with me, 
5.2.309	Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee. Re-enter GRATIANO. 
5.2.310	What is the matter? 
5.2.311	Behold, I have a weapon; 
5.2.312	A better never did itself sustain 
5.2.313	Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day 
5.2.314	That, with this little arm and this good sword, 
5.2.315	I have made my way through more impediments 
5.2.316	Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast! 
5.2.317	Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now. 
5.2.318	Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd; 
5.2.319	Here is my journey's end, here is my butt, 
5.2.320	And very sea-mark of my utmost sail. 
5.2.321	Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear; 
5.2.322	Man but a rush against Othello's breast, 
5.2.323	And he retires. Where should Othello go? 
5.2.324	Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench! 
5.2.325	Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt, 
5.2.326	This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven, 
5.2.327	And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl! 
5.2.328	Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave! 
5.2.329	Whip me, ye devils, 
5.2.330	>From the possession of this heavenly sight! 
5.2.331	Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur! 
5.2.332	Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire! 
5.2.333	O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead! 
5.2.334	Oh! Oh! Oh! Enter LODOVICO, MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair, and Officers with IAGO, prisoner. 
5.2.335	Where is this rash and most unfortunate man? 
5.2.336	That's he that was Othello: here I am. 
5.2.337	Where is that viper? bring the villain forth. 
5.2.338	I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable. 
5.2.339	If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee. Wounds Iago. 
5.2.340	Wrench his sword from him. 
5.2.341	I bleed, sir; but not kill'd. 
5.2.342	I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live; 
5.2.343	For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die. 
5.2.344	O thou Othello, that wert once so good, 
5.2.345	Fall'n in the practice of a damned slave 
5.2.346	What shall be said to thee? 
5.2.347	Why, any thing: 
5.2.348	An honourable murderer, if you will; 
5.2.349	For nought I did in hate, but all in honour. 
5.2.350	This wretch hath part confess'd his villany: 
5.2.351	Did you and he consent in Cassio's death? 
5.2.352	Ay. 
5.2.353	Dear general, I never gave you cause. 
5.2.354	I do believe it, and I ask you pardon. 
5.2.355	Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil 
5.2.356	Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body? 
5.2.357	Demand me nothing: what you know, you know: 
5.2.358	>From this time forth I never will speak word. 
5.2.359	What, not to pray? 
5.2.360	Torments will ope your lips, 
5.2.361	Well, thou dost best. 
5.2.362	Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n, 
5.2.363	Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter 
5.2.364	Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo; 
5.2.365	And here another: the one of them imports 
5.2.366	The death of Cassio to be undertook 
5.2.367	By Roderigo. 
5.2.368	O villain! 
5.2.369	Most heathenish and most gross! 
5.2.370	Now here 's another discontented paper, 
5.2.371	Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems, 
5.2.372	Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain; 
5.2.373	But that belike Iago in the interim 
5.2.374	Came in and satisfied him. 
5.2.375	O the pernicious caitiff! 
5.2.376	How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief 
5.2.377	That was my wife's? 
5.2.378	I found it in my chamber: 
5.2.379	And he himself confess'd but even now 
5.2.380	That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose 
5.2.381	Which wrought to his desire. 
5.2.382	O fool! fool! fool! 
5.2.383	There is besides in Roderigo's letter, 
5.2.384	How he upbraids Iago, that he made him 
5.2.385	Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came 
5.2.386	That I was cast: and even but now he spake, 
5.2.387	After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him, 
5.2.388	Iago set him on. 
5.2.389	You must forsake this room, and go with us: 
5.2.390	Your power and your command is taken off, 
5.2.391	And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave, 
5.2.392	If there be any cunning cruelty 
5.2.393	That can torment him much and hold him long, 
5.2.394	It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest, 
5.2.395	Till that the nature of your fault be known 
5.2.396	To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away. 
5.2.397	Soft you; a word or two before you go. 
5.2.398	I have done the state some service, and they know 't. 
5.2.399	No more of that. I pray you, in your letters, 
5.2.400	When you shall these unlucky deeds relate, 
5.2.401	Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, 
5.2.402	Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak 
5.2.403	Of one that loved not wisely but too well; 
5.2.404	Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought 
5.2.405	Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand, 
5.2.406	Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away 
5.2.407	Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes, 
5.2.408	Albeit unused to the melting mood, 
5.2.409	Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees 
5.2.410	Their medicinal gum. Set you down this; 
5.2.411	And say besides, that in Aleppo once, 
5.2.412	Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk 
5.2.413	Beat a Venetian and traduced the state, 
5.2.414	I took by the throat the circumcised dog, 
5.2.415	And smote him, thus. Stabs himself. 
5.2.416	O bloody period! 
5.2.417	All that's spoke is marr'd. 
5.2.418	I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this; 
5.2.419	Killing myself, to die upon a kiss. Falls on the bed, and dies. 
5.2.420	This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon; 
5.2.421	For he was great of heart.
5.2.422	To Iago
5.2.423	O Spartan dog, 
5.2.424	More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea! 
5.2.425	Look on the tragic loading of this bed; 
5.2.426	This is thy work: the object poisons sight; 
5.2.427	Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house, 
5.2.428	And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor, 
5.2.429	For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor, 
5.2.430	Remains the censure of this hellish villain; 
5.2.431	The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it! 
5.2.432	Myself will straight aboard; and to the state 
5.2.433	This heavy act with heavy heart relate. Exeunt.
